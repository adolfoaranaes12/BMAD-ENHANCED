Implement proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios.\n<info added on 2025-09-11T01:43:07.991Z>\nBased on the completed context gathering, comprehensive research findings, and technical decisions made, this task is now ready for implementation. All required questions have been answered, dependencies resolved, and risks mitigated through the feature flag approach and efficient middleware patterns.\n\nThe implementation will follow these key technical decisions:\n- Express.js response interceptor middleware will be used for standardization\n- Centralized error handling will be implemented with ApiError class\n- Response formatter utilities will ensure consistent structure\n- Request ID tracking and response time middleware will be added\n- Backward compatibility will be maintained through feature flags\n\nThe standardized response format will include:\n- Success responses: data, metadata (requestId, timestamps, processing time, API version, pagination info, cache status), and status fields\n- Error responses: success: false, error object containing code, message, details, timestamp, requestId\n- HTTP status codes: 200/201/204 for success, 400/401/403/404/409/422/429 for client errors, 500/503 for server errors\n\nAll existing controllers will be updated to use these standardized formats with thorough testing to ensure no breaking changes affect existing API consumers. The implementation will be rolled out gradually using feature flags to maintain backward compatibility.\n</info added on 2025-09-11T01:43:07.991Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-11T01:49:30.791Z>\nBased on the codebase analysis findings, the following key issues and technical debt have been identified that directly impact this standardization effort:\n\nMultiple response format implementations exist across the codebase, including BaseController.wrapResponse(), api/middleware/errorHandler.ts, api/types/context.ts, and AnalyticsController, each with different structures and inconsistent usage. Error handling is particularly fragmented with three distinct formats found in BaseController.handleError(), api/middleware/errorHandler.ts, and presentation/middleware/errorHandler.ts, creating inconsistency in error responses across endpoints.\n\nHTTP status code usage shows inconsistencies where some controllers return 400 for all errors instead of appropriate status codes, and while success codes (200, 201, 204) are generally used correctly, their application is not standardized. Controller response patterns vary significantly with ConversationController using BaseController methods, AnalyticsController implementing custom formats, and EscalationController mixing different approaches.\n\nMetadata handling is inconsistent across the codebase with varying implementations for request ID generation, timestamp formats, API version inclusion, and missing processing time tracking. Specific integration challenges include the AnalyticsController's divergent response structure, three different error response formats requiring unification, duplicated response wrapper functions, inconsistent status code mapping, and lack of standardized metadata inclusion.\n\nThe technical debt identified includes the need to unify three different error response formats, eliminate duplicated response wrapper functions, standardize status code mapping, and establish consistent metadata inclusion. These findings confirm the external research and provide concrete implementation details for addressing the standardization requirements, particularly highlighting the need for centralized response standardization middleware to replace the current scattered implementation approach.\n</info added on 2025-09-11T01:49:30.791Z>",
