			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Standardize API Response Formats",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of standardized response formats into specific components: response wrapper structure, error response standardization, HTTP status code mapping, and controller integration. Define the technical specifications for each component and establish clear implementation patterns.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves creating consistent API responses across multiple endpoints, which requires standardizing response structures, error formats, and status codes. This involves middleware implementation, controller modifications, and ensuring backward compatibility. The complexity is moderate due to the need for cross-cutting changes and maintaining existing API contracts."

			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Update API Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for documentation structure standardization, example validation and updating, and comprehensive coverage of authentication and error scenarios. Include validation steps to ensure documentation accuracy matches implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Documentation updates require aligning written specifications with actual implementation details. This involves reviewing all endpoints, validating examples, and ensuring comprehensive coverage of authentication flows and error responses. The task is moderately complex due to the need for accuracy and completeness across multiple API aspects."

			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose error handling implementation into error type classification, standardized response formatting, service-specific error mapping, and validation error handling. Define error hierarchies and ensure consistent application across all endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling requires standardizing responses while handling various error types including service-specific and validation errors. The complexity is higher due to security considerations, consistent formatting requirements, and the need to map various exception types to appropriate HTTP status codes across multiple endpoints."

		{
			"taskId": 30,
			"taskTitle": "Execute Integration Testing",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure integration testing into test scenario design, authentication/authorization validation, performance benchmarking, security testing, and load testing. Create comprehensive test plans for each area and establish success criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Integration testing encompasses multiple testing domains including functional validation, performance testing, security assessment, and load testing. The high complexity stems from the need to cover all API endpoints with CQRS service integration, validate authentication flows, and establish performance benchmarks while ensuring comprehensive test coverage."
