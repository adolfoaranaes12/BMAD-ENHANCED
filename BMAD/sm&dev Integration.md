## ✅ **Correct Workflow Understanding:**

### 🔄 **Complete Complexity Field Workflow:**

1. **📋 Scrum Master Creates Tasks** (from story)
   - Creates tasks and subtasks based on user story
   - Uses `generate-tasks-from-story` command

2. **🔍 Scrum Master Populates Initial Complexity** (using rules)
   - Runs `complexity-analysis` to generate complexity scores
   - Populates `context_requirements` (questions, inputs, dependencies, risks)
   - Sets `gathering_strategy` flags
   - Ensures `context_complete: false` initially

3. **��‍💻 Developer Fills Context Answers** (gathering phase)
   - Uses `context-gathering` command
   - Populates `context_answers` using research tool
   - Documents findings, decisions, and rationale
   - Sets `context_complete: true` when ready

4. **🚀 Developer Starts Implementation** (only when ready)
   - Checks `context_complete: true` and `implementation_ready: true`
   - Uses `develop-story` command
   - Implements task following the gathered context

### �� **Visual Flow:**

```
Story → Tasks → Complexity Analysis → Context Gathering → Implementation
  ↓        ↓           ↓                    ↓                ↓
SM       SM         SM (Rules)           DEV              DEV
```

### 🎯 **Key Gates:**

- **Gate 1**: Tasks created with complexity field structure
- **Gate 2**: Context requirements populated by Scrum Master
- **Gate 3**: Context answers gathered by Developer
- **Gate 4**: `context_complete: true` - Implementation can begin

### 🔧 **Commands Used:**

| Phase | Agent | Command | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | SM | `generate-tasks` | Create tasks from story |
| 2 | SM | `complexity-analysis` | Populate complexity field |
| 3 | DEV | `context-gathering` | Fill context answers |
| 4 | DEV | `develop-story` | Implement with context |

### ⚠️ **Critical Rules:**

- **NEVER** start implementation without `context_complete: true`
- **ALWAYS** populate complete complexity field structure
- **ALWAYS** document context gathering and decisions
- **ALWAYS** use research tool for context gathering

This ensures **context-driven development** where every task is fully understood before implementation begins! 🎉

Is this the workflow you want to implement, or would you like me to adjust anything?
