# BMAD → Claude Code Enhanced: Migration Plan

**Project:** BMAD Enhanced
**Goal:** Leverage BMAD's agent architecture and workflow patterns to enhance Claude Code with subagents and skills
**Date:** 2025-10-28

---

## Vision Statement

Create a Claude Code enhancement that combines:
- **BMAD's context engineering** (hyper-detailed task specs)
- **Claude Code's native capabilities** (subagents, skills, MCP integration)
- **Improved workflow orchestration** (planning → implementation → review)

**Result:** A development workflow where context never gets lost, quality is systematic, and AI agents have clear role boundaries.

---

## Architecture Comparison

### Current BMAD Pattern
```
Planning Phase (Web UI):
  Analyst → PM → Architect → PO
  Output: PRD + Architecture (sharded)

Development Phase (IDE):
  SM reads PRD + Architecture → Creates hyper-detailed story
  Dev reads story only → Implements sequentially
  QA reviews → Quality gate

Key: Story file contains ALL context needed
```

### Proposed Claude Code Enhancement
```
Planning Phase (Claude Code Skill):
  Planning skill reads requirements → Creates detailed task spec
  Task spec embeds: Context, architecture, standards, file locations
  Output: .claude/tasks/{task-id}.md with full context

Implementation Phase (Claude Code Subagent):
  Implementation subagent reads task spec only
  Executes sequentially with validation checkpoints
  Output: Code + tests + completion notes

Review Phase (Claude Code Skill):
  Quality skill performs risk assessment
  Test design validation
  Requirements traceability
  NFR checks (security, performance, reliability)
  Output: Quality gate with rationale
```

**Purpose:** Assess implementation risks before development (BMAD pattern)

**Risk Categories:**
- Technical: Complexity, unknowns, dependencies
- Security: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- Performance: Scalability, response time, resource usage
- Data: Integrity, migrations, consistency
- Business: Impact scope, user dependencies
- Operational: Deployment, monitoring, rollback

**Risk Scoring:** Probability (1-3) × Impact (1-3) = Risk Score (1-9)
- 9: Critical (highest risk)
- 6-8: High risk
- 3-5: Medium risk
- 1-2: Low risk

**Output:** `.claude/quality/{task-id}-risk.md`

```markdown
# Risk Profile: [Task Title]

## Risk Matrix

| Category | Risk | P | I | Score | Mitigation |
|----------|------|---|---|-------|------------|
| Security | SQL injection in user input | 2 | 3 | 6 | Use parameterized queries, input validation |
| Performance | N+1 queries in listing | 3 | 2 | 6 | Add eager loading, pagination |
| Technical | Complex state management | 2 | 2 | 4 | Unit tests for state transitions |

## High-Risk Areas (Score ≥ 6)
1. SQL injection vulnerability (Score: 6)
   - Mitigation: Use ORM with parameterized queries
   - Validation: Security audit before merge

2. Performance degradation (Score: 6)

```markdown
# Requirements Traceability: [Task Title]

## Traceability Matrix

| AC | Implementation | Tests | Coverage | Status |
|----|---------------|-------|----------|--------|
| AC1 | `auth/signup.ts:42-67` | `signup.test.ts:15-89` | 100% | ✓ COMPLETE |
| AC2 | `auth/password.ts:12-34` | `password.test.ts:8-56` | 85% | ⚠ GAP |
| AC3 | `auth/email.ts:78-95` | Missing | 0% | ✗ MISSING |

## Coverage Analysis

### AC1: User can create account (✓ COMPLETE)
**Given** a user visits the signup page
**When** they enter valid email and password
**Then** account is created and confirmation email sent

**Implementation:**
- File: `src/auth/signup.ts:42-67`
- Logic: Validates input → Creates user → Sends email

**Tests:**
- `signup.test.ts:15-30` - Valid signup flow
- `signup.test.ts:31-45` - Invalid email rejected
- `signup.test.ts:46-60` - Duplicate email prevented
- `signup.integration.test.ts:8-22` - Database interaction
- `signup.e2e.test.ts:12-45` - End-to-end flow

**Coverage:** 100% (5 tests, all scenarios)

### AC2: Password requirements enforced (⚠ GAP)
**Given** a user enters password
**When** password doesn't meet requirements
**Then** error shown and signup prevented

**Implementation:**
- File: `src/auth/password.ts:12-34`
- Logic: Length check → Complexity check → Common password check

**Tests:**
- `password.test.ts:8-20` - Minimum length validated
- `password.test.ts:21-35` - Complexity requirements checked
- Missing: Common password dictionary check

**Coverage:** 85% (2/3 scenarios)
**Gap:** No test for common password rejection (Severity: HIGH)

### AC3: Email verification required (✗ MISSING)
**Status:** No tests found for this acceptance criterion
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** Core functionality untested
```

## Appendix: Key BMAD Patterns to Remember

### 1. Context Embedding Pattern
```
Planning Agent → Reads all relevant architecture
              → Extracts specific technical details
              → Embeds in task spec with source references
              → Implementation agent reads ONLY task spec
```

### 2. Sequential Execution Pattern
```
For each task:
  Implement → Test → Validate → Update checkbox
HALT if:
  - 3 consecutive failures
  - Ambiguous requirements
  - Missing dependencies
```

### 3. Quality Gate Pattern
```
Assessment → PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL decision
          → Rationale with evidence
          → Action items (if needed)
          → WAIVED option with approver
```

### 4. Persona Constraint Pattern
```
Agent Definition:
  role: [Specific expertise]
  identity: [Core identity]
  core_principles:
    - [Constraint 1]
    - [Constraint 2]
  ONLY update: [Specific file sections]
  NEVER: [Forbidden actions]
```

### 5. Lazy Loading Pattern
```
Agent Startup:
  - Load agent definition
  - Load configuration
  - Greet + show commands
  - HALT

On Command Execution:
  - Load ONLY required dependencies
  - Execute task
  - Unload after completion
```
