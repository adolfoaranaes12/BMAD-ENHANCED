## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **templates.md Pattern is Gold**: The proven pattern from Session 1 worked perfectly. Creating comprehensive templates.md first, then trimming SKILL.md systematically, was highly efficient.

2. **Consistent Approach**: Following the same 7-step process for each skill (analyze → create directory → add frontmatter → create templates.md → trim → validate → document) created predictable, high-quality results.

3. **Reference to Templates**: Replacing verbose inline examples with "See: `references/templates.md#section`" saved 40-80 lines per skill while maintaining complete information.

4. **Early Validation**: Validating after each skill (not batch validation) caught issues immediately and built confidence.

5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Moving ALL output formats, examples, and templates to templates.md made SKILL.md focus purely on workflow logic.

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Initial File State**: Some skills (refactor-code, breakdown-epic, quality-gate) were already partially refactored from a previous session, but not fully optimized. Had to adapt approach to work with existing structure.

2. **Empty Reference Files**: quality-gate had 3 empty reference files (gate-decision-logic.md, gate-examples.md, gate-integration.md). Worked around by consolidating into templates.md.

3. **String Match Failures**: When trying to bulk-edit quality-gate dimension outputs, some string matches failed because the actual file content was different than expected. Had to read actual sections to match strings exactly.

4. **Line Count Variance**: Final line counts varied (265, 348, 447) but all passed Grade A. Learned that skill-creator is flexible on exact line count as long as workflow is clear and well-structured.

### Time Per Skill

- refactor-code: ~60 minutes
- breakdown-epic: ~75 minutes
- quality-gate: ~55 minutes

**Total:** ~190 minutes (~3.2 hours)

**Average:** ~63 minutes per skill (faster than Session 1 average of ~70 minutes)

---

## Patterns and Best Practices Reinforced

### 1. templates.md Structure

**Always Include:**
- Configuration format examples
- Step-by-step output templates (ALL workflow steps)
- Complete file format examples (with realistic data)
- Error message templates
- Integration examples (CI/CD, commands)

**Size Target:** 600-1,000 lines depending on skill complexity

### 2. SKILL.md Trimming Techniques

**Replace verbose sections with:**
```markdown
**Output:** Brief description of what's output

**See:** `references/templates.md#section-name` for complete format
```

**Condense sections:**
- Safety → bullet list (not paragraphs)
- Integration → 2-3 lines with reference
- Best Practices → numbered list (1 line each)

**Remove entirely:**
- "Using This Skill" (obvious from frontmatter)
- "Philosophy" (too verbose, not essential)
- "Limitations" (redundant with Routing Guidance)

### 3. Validation Approach

**Do NOT:**
- Wait to validate all skills at end
- Guess at line counts without validating
- Over-trim (too lean breaks workflow clarity)

**DO:**
- Validate immediately after trimming each skill
- Trust Grade A validation (if it passes, it's good)
- Accept variance in final line counts (265-447 all passed)

## Token Usage

**Start:** 0 tokens
**End:** ~127k tokens
**Percentage:** 63% of 200k budget
**Efficiency:** ~42k tokens per skill average

**Breakdown:**
- Skill 1 (refactor-code): ~35k tokens
- Skill 2 (breakdown-epic): ~50k tokens
- Skill 3 (quality-gate): ~27k tokens
- Documentation: ~15k tokens

## Next Steps

### Session 3 Recommendations

**Target:** Refactor next 3 skills (44% → 61%)

**Recommended Priorities:**

1. **run-tests** (development) - Estimated 500-700 lines → ~350 lines
2. **nfr-assess** (quality) - Estimated 800-1,000 lines → ~370 lines
3. **trace-requirements** (quality) - Estimated 800-1,000 lines → ~370 lines

**Estimated Time:** 3-3.5 hours (similar to Session 2)

**Why These:**
- run-tests: Development skill, complements implement-feature and refactor-code
- nfr-assess: Quality skill, integrates with quality-gate (already refactored)
- trace-requirements: Quality skill, also integrates with quality-gate

**Pattern to Use:**
- Same 7-step process proven in Sessions 1 and 2
- templates.md pattern (600-800 lines)
- Target SKILL.md: 330-390 lines
- Validate incrementally (after each skill)
