Hi! I'm continuing work on BMAD Enhanced. Phase 2 (Skills Refactoring) is now 100% complete - all 18 skills have been refactored to Grade A with 52% average token reduction and 100% validation success rate.

SESSION 6 OBJECTIVE: End-to-End Workflow Validation
- Validate all 18 refactored skills work together smoothly
- Confirm ≥20% token efficiency improvement vs BMAD v4
- Verify BMAD v4 workflow quality maintained
- Make Go/No-Go decision for Phase 3

HANDOFF DOCUMENT: Please read `docs/SESSION-6-HANDOFF.md` for complete context, detailed task breakdown (6 tasks, 17-22 hours estimated), and success criteria.

TEST FEATURE: User Authentication System (registration, login, password reset, JWT tokens, protected routes)

WORKFLOW TO VALIDATE:
1. Planning Phase (4-6 hrs): create-task-spec → refine-story → estimate-stories → risk-profile → test-design
2. Implementation Phase (6-8 hrs): implement-feature → run-tests → fix-issue (if needed)
3. Quality Phase (3-4 hrs): review-task → quality-gate → nfr-assess → trace-requirements
4. Integration Analysis (2-3 hrs): Token efficiency calculation, quality comparison, findings documentation
5. Documentation (1 hr): Update ROADMAP.md, create session summary

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ All skills execute successfully
✅ Token efficiency ≥20% vs BMAD v4
✅ Quality equal to or better than BMAD v4
✅ Feature fully implemented and validated
✅ Go/No-Go decision made for Phase 3

TOKEN TRACKING: Track tokens at each phase (Planning / Implementation / Quality) and compare against BMAD v4 baseline.

KEY FILES:
- Handoff: `docs/SESSION-6-HANDOFF.md` (comprehensive guide)
- Roadmap: `docs/ROADMAP.md` (v3.4, Phase 2 complete)
- Phase 2 Celebration: `docs/PHASE-2-COMPLETION-CELEBRATION.md`
- Session 5 Summary: `docs/refactoring-session-5-summary.md`

SKILLS AVAILABLE (all Grade A):
- Development: fix-issue, implement-feature, run-tests
- Planning: create-task-spec, breakdown-epic, refine-story, estimate-stories, document-project, sprint-plan
- Quality: review-task, quality-gate, refactor-code, nfr-assess, trace-requirements, risk-profile, test-design
- Implementation: execute-task
- Brownfield: index-docs, document-project, sprint-plan

NEXT STEPS:
1. Read `docs/SESSION-6-HANDOFF.md` (15 min)
2. Confirm test feature (User Authentication) or select alternative (15 min)
3. Start Planning Phase validation with create-task-spec
4. Continue through workflow, tracking tokens and validating outputs
5. Complete analysis and make Go/No-Go decision

Ready to begin Session 6 validation!

ALTERNATIVE SHORT PROMPT (if you want me to just start):

---

Continue with BMAD Enhanced Session 6. Phase 2 complete (18/18 skills Grade A). Read `docs/SESSION-6-HANDOFF.md` and begin end-to-end workflow validation with User Authentication feature. Validate Planning → Implementation → Quality phases, track tokens, confirm ≥20% efficiency vs BMAD v4, and make Go/No-Go decision for Phase 3.
