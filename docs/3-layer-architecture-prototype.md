# 3-Layer Architecture Prototype - Complete

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Prototype Complete
**Architecture Pattern:** Commands → Skills → Subagents

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully prototyped the 3-layer architecture for BMAD Enhanced using the **implement workflow** as the validation case. The prototype demonstrates:

- ✅ **Primitives**: Testable, observable primitives
- ✅ **Workflow Skills**: Contract-based composition with acceptance criteria
- ✅ **Subagents**: Intelligent routing with guardrails

**Key Achievement:** Validated that the 3-layer pattern works with Claude Code's skill system and BMAD's existing structure.

---

## What Was Built

### Layer 1: Primitives (bmad-commands skill)

**Location:** `.claude/skills/bmad-commands/`

**Components:**
- `SKILL.md` - Command documentation and usage
- `scripts/read_file.py` - Read files with metadata
- `scripts/run_tests.py` - Execute tests with structured output
- `references/command-contracts.yaml` - Formal contracts

**Key Features:**
- JSON input/output for all commands
- Structured error handling
- Built-in telemetry
- Testable (can run independently)
- Exit codes: 0=success, 1=failure

**Example Usage:**
```bash
python .claude/skills/bmad-commands/scripts/read_file.py \
  --path workspace/tasks/task-001.md \
  --output json
```

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "outputs": {
    "content": "...",
    "line_count": 45,
    "size_bytes": 1024
  },
  "telemetry": {
    "command": "read_file",
    "duration_ms": 12
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

---

### Layer 2: Skills (implement-v2 skill)

**Location:** `.claude/skills/development/implement-v2/`

**Components:**
- `SKILL.md` - Lean implementation guide with contracts
- `references/tdd-workflow.md` - Detailed TDD patterns
- `references/refactoring-patterns.md` - Refactoring guide

**Key Features:**
- YAML frontmatter with formal contracts
- Acceptance criteria defined upfront
- Uses bmad-commands for operations
- Progressive disclosure (details in references/)
- Reduced from 1573 lines → ~300 lines (81% reduction)

**Contract Example:**
```yaml
acceptance:
  - tests_passing: "All tests must pass"
  - coverage_threshold: "Test coverage >= 80%"
  - no_syntax_errors: "Code must have no syntax errors"
inputs:
  task_id:
    type: string
    required: true
outputs:
  implementation_complete: boolean
  test_coverage_percent: number
telemetry:
  emit: "skill.implement.completed"
  track: ["task_id", "coverage_percent", "duration_ms"]
```

**Usage Pattern:**
```markdown
### Step 1: Read Task Spec

Execute: python .claude/skills/bmad-commands/scripts/read_file.py ...

Parse outputs.content for task specification.
```

---

### Layer 3: Subagents (james-developer-v2)

**Location:** `.claude/agents/james-developer-v2.md` (single file)

**Components:**
- Single markdown file with YAML frontmatter
- Routing logic inline (not separate yaml file)
- Guardrails inline (not separate yaml file)
- All configuration consolidated per official Claude Code format

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent routing based on complexity
- Automated complexity assessment
- Guardrails enforcement
- Acceptance criteria verification
- Escalation paths
- Full telemetry

**Routing Logic:**
```yaml
routes:
  - condition: "complexity <= 30 AND files_affected <= 3"
    skill: "implement-v2"
    reason: "Simple implementation"

  - condition: "complexity > 30 AND complexity <= 60"
    skill: "implement-feature"
    reason: "Medium complexity"

  - condition: "complexity > 60"
    skill: "implement-with-discovery"
    reason: "High complexity"
    escalate_to_user: true
```

**Guardrails:**
```yaml
global:
  max_files_per_change: 5
  max_diff_lines: 400
  require_tests: true
  min_test_coverage: 80
  never_commit_failing_tests: true
```

---

## Architecture Validation

### Data Flow

```
User: @james *implement task-auth-002
  ↓
James Subagent V2:
  1. Load task spec (bmad-commands: read_file)
  2. Assess complexity (routing-rules.yaml)
  3. Select skill (routing logic)
  4. Check guardrails (guardrails.yaml)
  5. Execute skill
  ↓
Implement-v2 Skill:
  1. Load task spec (bmad-commands: read_file)
  2. Write failing tests (RED)
  3. Implement code (GREEN)
  4. Refactor (while tests green)
  5. Run tests (bmad-commands: run_tests)
  6. Verify acceptance criteria
  ↓
James Subagent V2:
  1. Verify skill outputs
  2. Check acceptance criteria
  3. Emit telemetry
  4. Return to user
  ↓
Output:
  {
    "success": true,
    "implementation_complete": true,
    "tests_passed": true,
    "coverage_percent": 87,
    "next_steps": ["@quinn *review task-auth-002"]
  }
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Commands as Scripts (Not Separate Skills)

**Decision:** Commands are Python scripts within bmad-commands skill.

**Rationale:**
- Commands need to be callable from skills
- Skills can't easily invoke other skills
- Scripts are deterministic and testable
- JSON I/O provides clear contracts

**Alternative Considered:** Commands as separate skills
**Why Rejected:** Skills calling skills creates circular dependencies

---

### 2. YAML Frontmatter for Contracts

**Decision:** Skills use YAML frontmatter for metadata and contracts.

**Rationale:**
- Keeps markdown-first format
- Frontmatter parsed separately
- Doesn't break existing skills
- Progressive enhancement

**Alternative Considered:** Full YAML skills
**Why Rejected:** Loses markdown readability

---

### 3. References for Detailed Docs

**Decision:** Move detailed documentation to references/ files.

**Rationale:**
- Keeps SKILL.md lean
- Claude loads references only when needed
- Progressive disclosure pattern
- Reduces context window usage

**Alternative Considered:** Everything in SKILL.md
**Why Rejected:** 1573-line skills are too large

---

### 4. Subagents Route, Skills Execute

**Decision:** Subagents contain routing logic, skills contain workflows.

**Rationale:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Skills remain reusable
- Routing logic centralized
- Easier to test

**Alternative Considered:** Skills contain routing
**Why Rejected:** Makes skills less reusable

---

## Validation Results

### ✅ Testability

**Commands:**
- Can run independently: `python scripts/read_file.py --path README.md`
- Unit testable (Python scripts)
- Known inputs/outputs

**Skills:**
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Can verify outputs programmatically
- Deterministic (uses commands)

**Subagents:**
- Routing logic testable (YAML parsing)
- Guardrails verifiable
- Telemetry observable

---

### ✅ Observability

**Telemetry at Every Layer:**

**Commands:**
```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "command": "read_file",
    "duration_ms": 12,
    "path": "...",
    "line_count": 45
  }
}
```

**Skills:**
```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "skill": "implement",
    "duration_ms": 45000,
    "tests_total": 12,
    "coverage_percent": 87
  }
}
```

**Subagents:**
```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "agent": "james-v2",
    "routing": {"complexity": 25, "skill": "implement-v2"},
    "execution": {"duration_ms": 45000}
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ Safety

**Guardrails Prevent:**
- Excessive file changes (>5 files)
- Large diffs (>400 lines)
- Committing failing tests
- Modifying sensitive files (.env, .key)
- Low test coverage (<80%)

**Escalation Triggers:**
- High complexity tasks
- Guardrail violations
- Repeated failures
- Security concerns

---

### ✅ Composability

**Commands:**
- Used by multiple skills
- Standard JSON I/O
- Versioned contracts

**Skills:**
- Called by multiple subagents
- Formal inputs/outputs
- Reusable workflows

**Subagents:**
- Route to multiple skills
- Context-aware selection
- Enforc shared guardrails

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Commands as Scripts**
   - Python scripts integrate cleanly
   - JSON I/O is straightforward
   - Testable outside Claude

2. **YAML Frontmatter**
   - Doesn't break existing skills
   - Machine-parseable contracts
   - Keeps markdown readability

3. **References for Details**
   - SKILL.md stayed lean
   - Progressive disclosure works
   - Reduced context window usage

4. **Routing Logic**
   - YAML makes rules clear
   - Easy to add/modify routes
   - Complexity scoring is transparent

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Skills Can't Call Skills**
   - Had to use scripts instead
   - Commands can't be separate skills
   - Workaround: Scripts in command skill

2. **No Native JSON Parsing**
   - Skills must parse JSON manually
   - Can't directly use command outputs
   - Workaround: Clear parsing instructions

3. **No State Between Steps**
   - Each skill execution is stateless
   - Can't maintain session data
   - Workaround: Pass data in telemetry

4. **Manual Acceptance Verification**
   - No built-in verification engine
   - Skills must self-verify
   - Workaround: Explicit verification step

### Surprises

1. **Progressive Disclosure is Powerful**
   - 81% reduction in SKILL.md size
   - Still maintains full functionality
   - References loaded on-demand

2. **Telemetry is Essential**
   - Debugging without it is hard
   - Enables observability
   - Foundation for optimization

3. **Guardrails Catch Real Issues**
   - Would have prevented actual bugs
   - Forces better task breakdown
   - Improves code quality
