# BMAD Enhanced Development Roadmap

**Version:** 3.2
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** Claude Code Architecture 100% Complete | Skills Enhancement 78% Complete (14/18) | Terminology 100% Standardized

---

## Vision Statement

**BMAD Enhanced is a migration of BMAD Method v4 (stable) to Claude Code native architecture**, optimized for token efficiency through progressive disclosure and modular skill design.

**What We're Doing:**
Taking the proven BMAD Method v4 workflow and agents, and adapting them to work natively with Claude Code's skills, subagents, and slash commands architecture - while dramatically improving token efficiency.

**Migration Goals:**
- **100% Claude Code compliant** - Skills, subagents, and optional slash commands
- **Token efficiency** - 20%+ better than BMAD v4 through progressive disclosure
- **Preserve workflow quality** - Maintain BMAD v4's proven methodology effectiveness
- **Modular and portable** - Packageable skills that work anywhere
- **Maintain compatibility** - Keep BMAD v4 workflow concepts (Planning → Development cycle)

**Success Metrics:**
- Token usage: 20%+ better than BMAD Method v4
- Code maintainability: 70%+ token reduction per skill
- Quality: Equal to BMAD v4 workflow outcomes
- Claude Code compliance: 100%
- Skills refactored: 18/18 to Grade A

**What This Is:**
✅ Migration of BMAD v4 to Claude Code architecture
✅ Token optimization through progressive disclosure
✅ Modular skill-based implementation
✅ Claude Code native patterns (skills, subagents, slash commands)

**What This Is NOT:**
❌ Not a replacement for BMAD Method v4 (it's an adaptation)
❌ Not trying to match v6 alpha features
❌ Not a completely new methodology

## Current Status (2025-10-29)

### ✅ Claude Code Compliance: 100% COMPLETE

**Architecture:** Fully compliant with official Claude Code patterns

**Completed Migrations:**
- ✅ **Skills** → Following official skill-creator pattern
  - Location: `.claude/skills/` with proper structure
  - Format: SKILL.md + references/ for progressive disclosure
  - YAML frontmatter for metadata
  - 18 skills total (2 refactored to Grade A, 16 in progress)

- ✅ **Subagents** → Following official subagent pattern
  - Location: `.claude/agents/` (migrated from `.claude/subagents/`)
  - Format: Single `.md` file per subagent with YAML frontmatter
  - Current: 4 subagents (alex-planner, james-developer-v2, quinn-quality, orchestrator)

- ✅ **3-Layer Architecture** → Properly structured
  - Layer 1 (Primitives): bmad-commands skill with Python scripts
  - Layer 2 (Workflow Skills): 18 skills across all domains
  - Layer 3 (Subagents): Intelligent routing and coordination

- ✅ **Terminology** → 100% aligned with docs.claude.com
  - "Skills" (not "command skills")
  - "Subagents" (not "agents")
  - "Primitives" (not "commands layer")

- ✅ **Documentation** → 16 comprehensive docs
  - Architecture guides
  - Refactoring templates
  - Standards and conventions
  - Migration tracking and templates

**Official Claude Code References:**

### 📊 Migration Source: BMAD Method v4 (Stable)

**What We're Migrating:**

**From BMAD v4:**
- Planning workflow (Analyst → PM → Architect → PO)
- Development cycle (SM → Dev → QA)
- Agent system (10 specialized agents)
- Templates and tasks
- Test Architect (QA) capabilities
- Technical preferences system

**To Claude Code:**
- Skills (SKILL.md + references/) - replaces tasks/templates

## Migration Context & Strategy

**"Migration" in BMAD Enhanced refers to TWO distinct activities:**

### 1. Claude Code Architecture Migration ✅ 100% COMPLETE (October 2025)

**Goal:** Full compliance with official Claude Code documentation
- Reference: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills
- Reference: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
- Reference: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands

**Completed:**
- ✅ **Skills** follow official skill-creator pattern
  - Location: `.claude/skills/` ✅
  - Structure: SKILL.md + references/ for progressive disclosure ✅
  - YAML frontmatter with name and description ✅
  - 18 skills properly structured ✅

- ✅ **Subagents** follow official subagent pattern
  - Location: `.claude/agents/` (migrated from `.claude/subagents/`) ✅
  - Format: Single `.md` file per subagent ✅
  - YAML frontmatter with metadata ✅
  - 4 subagents implemented (alex-planner, james-developer-v2, quinn-quality, orchestrator) ✅

- ✅ **3-Layer Architecture** properly implemented
  - Layer 1 (Primitives): bmad-commands skill ✅
  - Layer 2 (Workflows): 18 skills across domains ✅
  - Layer 3 (Subagents): Intelligent routing ✅

- ✅ **Terminology** 100% aligned with docs.claude.com
  - "Skills" (not "command skills") ✅
  - "Subagents" (not "agents") ✅
  - "Primitives" (not "commands layer") ✅

- ✅ **Documentation** 16 comprehensive docs covering architecture, patterns, and standards ✅

**Status:** 🎉 100% COMPLETE - BMAD Enhanced is now fully Claude Code native

**Next Step:** Week 0 terminology standardization (2-3 hours) to resolve minor naming inconsistencies

---

### 2. Skills Enhancement Migration 🔄 IN PROGRESS (78%)

**Goal:** Refactor 18 skills from BMAD Method v4 to Grade A (token-efficient, portable, compliant)

**Progress:**
- ✅ Session 1: 5 skills (67% avg reduction)
- ✅ Session 2: 3 skills (60% avg reduction)
- ✅ Session 3: 3 skills (51% avg reduction)
- ✅ Session 4: 3 skills (36% avg reduction)
- 🔄 4 skills remaining (~20 hours)

**What We're Migrating from BMAD v4:**
- ✅ Planning workflow (Analyst → PM → Architect → PO)
- ✅ Development cycle (SM → Dev → QA)
- ✅ Agent system → adapted to Claude Code subagents
- ✅ Templates and tasks → adapted to skills with progressive disclosure
- ✅ Test Architect (QA) capabilities
- ✅ Technical preferences system

**What We're NOT Migrating:**
- ❌ Monolithic task files → Using modular SKILL.md + references/
- ❌ Token-heavy prompts → Using progressive disclosure
- ❌ Rigid workflow structure → Flexible skill composition

**Status:** Phase 2 (Weeks 1-6)

## Appendix: Detailed Task Breakdowns

### A. Automated Refactoring Skill Specification

**File:** `.claude/skills/quality/refactor-code.md`

**Purpose:** Safely improve code quality through automated refactoring

**Inputs:**
- Task specification file
- Implementation file paths
- Quality findings (from review-task)
- Test file paths

**Process:**
1. Analyze code for refactoring opportunities
2. Prioritize refactorings by safety and impact
3. Apply refactorings one at a time
4. Run tests after each refactoring
5. Rollback if tests fail
6. Log all changes with rationale

**Outputs:**
- Refactored code
- Refactoring log (what, why, when)
- Updated quality notes

**Safety Guarantees:**
- Tests must pass before and after
- Automatic rollback on test failure
- No behavioral changes
- All changes logged

---

### B. Brownfield Documentation Skill Specification

**File:** `.claude/skills/planning/document-project.md`

**Purpose:** Generate architecture documentation from existing codebase

**Inputs:**
- Project root path
- Language/framework
- Existing docs (if any)

**Process:**
1. Scan project structure
2. Analyze dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Identify patterns and conventions
4. Extract data models
5. Map API endpoints
6. Generate architecture.md
7. Generate standards.md

**Outputs:**
- docs/architecture.md
- docs/standards.md
- docs/patterns.md
- Confidence scores for each section

**Limitations:**
- May miss implicit patterns
- Requires validation by human
- Works best with 10K-100K line codebases

## Next Actions

**Week 0 (This Week) - Terminology Standardization:** ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ **Resolved all terminology inconsistencies**
   - **Skill naming:** Standardized "bmad-commands" vs "bmad-primitives" across all docs
     - Kept "bmad-commands" (matches actual skill name in `.claude/skills/`)
     - Updated all docs using "bmad-primitives" → "bmad-commands"
   - **Layer 1 naming:** Verified consistent use of "Primitives" (not "Primitive Skills Layer")
   - Actual effort: 2 hours
   - **Result:** All documentation now uses consistent terminology

**Immediate (Session 5) - Final 4 Skills:**
