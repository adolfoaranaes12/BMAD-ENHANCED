# BMAD Enhanced Development Roadmap

**Version:** 3.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** Claude Code Migration Complete, Skills Refactoring In Progress

---

## Vision Statement

**BMAD Enhanced is a migration of BMAD Method v4 (stable) to Claude Code native architecture**, optimized for token efficiency through progressive disclosure and modular skill design.

**What We're Doing:**
Taking the proven BMAD Method v4 workflow and agents, and adapting them to work natively with Claude Code's skills, subagents, and slash commands architecture - while dramatically improving token efficiency.

**Migration Goals:**
- **100% Claude Code compliant** - Skills, subagents, and optional slash commands
- **Token efficiency** - 20%+ better than BMAD v4 through progressive disclosure
- **Preserve workflow quality** - Maintain BMAD v4's proven methodology effectiveness
- **Modular and portable** - Packageable skills that work anywhere
- **Maintain compatibility** - Keep BMAD v4 workflow concepts (Planning → Development cycle)

**Success Metrics:**
- Token usage: 20%+ better than BMAD Method v4
- Code maintainability: 70%+ token reduction per skill
- Quality: Equal to BMAD v4 workflow outcomes
- Claude Code compliance: 100%
- Skills refactored: 18/18 to Grade A

**What This Is:**
✅ Migration of BMAD v4 to Claude Code architecture
✅ Token optimization through progressive disclosure
✅ Modular skill-based implementation
✅ Claude Code native patterns (skills, subagents, slash commands)

**What This Is NOT:**
❌ Not a replacement for BMAD Method v4 (it's an adaptation)
❌ Not trying to match v6 alpha features
❌ Not a completely new methodology

---

## Current Status (2025-10-29)

### ✅ Claude Code Compliance: 100% COMPLETE

**Architecture:** Fully compliant with official Claude Code patterns

**Completed Migrations:**
- ✅ **Skills** → Following official skill-creator pattern
  - Location: `.claude/skills/` with proper structure
  - Format: SKILL.md + references/ for progressive disclosure
  - YAML frontmatter for metadata
  - 18 skills total (2 refactored to Grade A, 16 in progress)

- ✅ **Subagents** → Following official subagent pattern
  - Location: `.claude/agents/` (migrated from `.claude/subagents/`)
  - Format: Single `.md` file per subagent with YAML frontmatter
  - Current: 4 subagents (alex-planner, james-developer-v2, quinn-quality, orchestrator)

- ✅ **3-Layer Architecture** → Properly structured
  - Layer 1 (Primitives): bmad-commands skill with Python scripts
  - Layer 2 (Workflow Skills): 18 skills across all domains
  - Layer 3 (Subagents): Intelligent routing and coordination

- ✅ **Terminology** → 100% aligned with docs.claude.com
  - "Skills" (not "command skills")
  - "Subagents" (not "agents")
  - "Primitives" (not "commands layer")

- ✅ **Documentation** → 16 comprehensive docs
  - Architecture guides
  - Refactoring templates
  - Standards and conventions
  - Migration tracking and templates

**Official Claude Code References:**
- Skills: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills
- Subagents: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
- Slash Commands: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands (optional feature)

### 📊 Migration Source: BMAD Method v4 (Stable)

**What We're Migrating:**

**From BMAD v4:**
- Planning workflow (Analyst → PM → Architect → PO)
- Development cycle (SM → Dev → QA)
- Agent system (10 specialized agents)
- Templates and tasks
- Test Architect (QA) capabilities
- Technical preferences system

**To Claude Code:**
- Skills (SKILL.md + references/) - replaces tasks/templates
- Subagents (.claude/agents/*.md) - replaces bmad-core/agents
- Optional slash commands - for quick operations
- 3-layer architecture (Primitives → Workflows → Subagents)
- Progressive disclosure for token efficiency

### 🟡 Skills Refactoring: 11% Complete (2 of 18)

**Refactored to Grade A (100% Claude Code compliant):**
- ✅ `fix-issue`: 949 lines → 306 lines (67% reduction)
- ✅ `estimate-stories`: 1,477 lines → 374 lines (75% reduction)

**Remaining Skills to Refactor (16):**
- **Planning (5)**: create-task-spec, breakdown-epic, refine-story, sprint-plan, document-project
- **Development (2)**: implement-feature, run-tests
- **Implementation (1)**: execute-task
- **Quality (7)**: review-task, refactor-code, nfr-assess, quality-gate, risk-profile, test-design, trace-requirements
- **Brownfield (1)**: index-docs

**Average Refactoring Metrics:**
- Token reduction: 72%
- Portability: 100% (all Grade A)
- Claude Code compliance: 100%

## Migration Context & Strategy

**"Migration" in BMAD Enhanced refers to TWO distinct activities:**

### 1. Claude Code Compliance Migration ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** 100% compliance with official Claude Code patterns

**Completed:**
- ✅ Skills follow skill-creator pattern (SKILL.md + references/)
- ✅ Subagents in `.claude/agents/` as single .md files
- ✅ 3-layer architecture properly structured
- ✅ Terminology aligned with docs.claude.com
- ✅ 16 comprehensive architecture docs

**Status:** COMPLETE - BMAD Enhanced is now 100% Claude Code native

---

### 2. Skills Enhancement Migration 🔄 IN PROGRESS (11%)

**Goal:** Refactor 18 skills from BMAD Method v4 to Grade A (token-efficient, portable, compliant)

**Progress:**
- ✅ fix-issue: 67% token reduction
- ✅ estimate-stories: 75% token reduction
- 🔄 16 skills remaining (80 hours)

**What We're Migrating from BMAD v4:**
- ✅ Planning workflow (Analyst → PM → Architect → PO)
- ✅ Development cycle (SM → Dev → QA)
- ✅ Agent system → adapted to Claude Code subagents
- ✅ Templates and tasks → adapted to skills with progressive disclosure
- ✅ Test Architect (QA) capabilities
- ✅ Technical preferences system

**What We're NOT Migrating:**
- ❌ Monolithic task files → Using modular SKILL.md + references/
- ❌ Token-heavy prompts → Using progressive disclosure
- ❌ Rigid workflow structure → Flexible skill composition

**Status:** Phase 2 (Weeks 1-6)
