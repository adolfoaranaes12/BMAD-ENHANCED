**Purpose:** Safely improve code quality through automated refactoring

**Inputs:**
- Task specification file
- Implementation file paths
- Quality findings (from review-task)
- Test file paths

**Process:**
1. Analyze code for refactoring opportunities
2. Prioritize refactorings by safety and impact
3. Apply refactorings one at a time
4. Run tests after each refactoring
5. Rollback if tests fail
6. Log all changes with rationale

**Outputs:**
- Refactored code
- Refactoring log (what, why, when)
- Updated quality notes

**Safety Guarantees:**
- Tests must pass before and after
- Automatic rollback on test failure
- No behavioral changes
- All changes logged
