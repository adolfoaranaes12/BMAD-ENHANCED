I'm working on BMAD Enhanced - refactoring skills from BMAD v4 to Claude Code architecture.

CURRENT STATUS:
- âœ… Week 0: Terminology standardization complete
- âœ… Architecture: 100% Claude Code compliant
- âœ… Skills refactored: 2/18 (11% complete)
  - fix-issue: Grade A, 67% token reduction
  - estimate-stories: Grade A, 75% token reduction

MY MISSION:
Refactor 3 high-priority skills to Grade A compliance:
1. implement-feature (development)
2. review-task (quality)
3. create-task-spec (planning)

SUCCESS CRITERIA PER SKILL:
- Grade A validation (skill-creator)
- 70%+ token reduction
- 300-400 lines in SKILL.md
- 3-5 reference files (1,500-2,500 total lines)
- Proper YAML frontmatter
- 100% portable

PROCESS (per skill, 4-5 hours):
1. Read & analyze current skill (15 min)
2. Create directory structure (5 min)
3. Add YAML frontmatter (20 min)
4. Streamline SKILL.md to 300-400 lines (60 min)
5. Create 3-5 reference files (90-120 min)
6. Remove old file (2 min)
7. Validate with skill-creator â†’ Grade A (20 min)
8. Document metrics (10 min)

PLEASE START BY:
1. Reading: docs/skill-refactoring-template.md
2. Studying: .claude/skills/development/fix-issue/SKILL.md (Grade A example)
3. Studying: .claude/skills/planning/estimate-stories/SKILL.md (Grade A example)

Then analyze implement-feature and create a refactoring plan.
