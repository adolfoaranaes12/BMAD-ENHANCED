## 🎓 What You Learned

### Key Success Patterns

1. **YAML Frontmatter is Critical**
   - Required for all skills
   - `name` + `description` format
   - Must be first thing in file

2. **Progressive Disclosure Works**
   - Lean SKILL.md (300-400 lines)
   - Detailed content in references/
   - Load only what's needed

3. **Token Efficiency Matters**
   - 67-75% reduction in tokens
   - Pay only for what you use
   - References loaded on demand

4. **Writing Style Matters**
   - Imperative form throughout
   - Trust Claude's knowledge
   - No second person ("you")

5. **Structure is Consistent**
   ```
   skill-name/
   ├── SKILL.md (focused workflow)
   └── references/ (detailed guides)
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Phase 2: Refactor Remaining 16 Skills

**You have everything you need:**

1. ✅ **2 validated examples** to reference
   - fix-issue (development skill)
   - estimate-stories (planning skill)

2. ✅ **Comprehensive guides**
   - Refactoring guide (process)
   - Refactoring template (step-by-step)
   - Validation report (quality bar)

3. ✅ **Proven process**

## 💬 Feedback & Questions

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I package the two refactored skills now?**
A: Yes! Both are validated and ready. However, you may want to wait until all skills are refactored to package them together.

**Q: Do I need to follow the template exactly?**
A: No. The template is a guide. Adapt it to fit each skill's needs. The key requirements are:
- YAML frontmatter ✅
- Under 500 lines ✅
- Progressive disclosure ✅

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Reference the examples (fix-issue, estimate-stories) and troubleshooting section in the template. The patterns are proven and work.

**Q: Should I create a shared references/ directory?**
A: Optional. You can create `.claude/skills/references/common/` for content shared across multiple skills (e.g., testing principles, code quality standards).
