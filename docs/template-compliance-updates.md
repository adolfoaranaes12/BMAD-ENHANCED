# Skill Refactoring Template - Compliance Updates

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Updated By:** Winston (Architect)
**Based On:** template-compliance-review.md recommendations

---

## Executive Summary

The skill-refactoring-template.md has been updated with **Priority 1 (CRITICAL)** and **Priority 2 (Important)** changes from the compliance review to address:

1. **Conceptual clarity** - Explaining that skills remain skills, layers define roles
2. **Portability emphasis** - Making it crystal clear skills must be portable
3. **Architecture understanding** - Helping users understand the 3-layer pattern
4. **Terminology clarification** - Clarifying bmad-commands and subagents

**Result:** Template now properly explains both skill-creator AND 3-layer architecture compliance while emphasizing portability.

## Changes Made

### Change 1: Added Architecture Overview Section

**Location:** After Quick Start Checklist (line 36)

**Lines Added:** ~75 lines

**Content:**
- Critical concept explanation: Layers define ROLES, not file structures
- Layer 1 definition: Primitive Skills (skills with scripts)
- Layer 2 definition: Workflow Skills (regular skills)
- Layer 3 definition: Subagents (NOT skills)
- Key principle: Skills stay portable
- Clear examples showing structure of each layer

**Key Message:**
> "All skills you create follow skill-creator patterns (SKILL.md, references/, etc.). The '3 layers' refers to the **ROLE skills play**, not different file structures."

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users understand skills remain skills
- ✅ Users understand bmad-commands IS A SKILL
- ✅ Users understand the difference between skills and subagents
- ✅ Users understand portability is maintained

---

### Change 2: Added Clarification to Step 4.5

**Location:** Step 4.5 beginning (line 637)

**Lines Added:** ~10 lines

**Content:**
```markdown
**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** bmad-commands IS A SKILL (not a separate layer type).

It's a special skill that:
- Bundles Python scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Follows skill-creator pattern (SKILL.md + scripts/ + references/)
- Is packageable and portable
- Plays "Layer 1" role (provides command primitives)

**Your skill structure stays the same.** You're just CALLING another skill's scripts.
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clarifies bmad-commands nature
- ✅ Prevents confusion about creating "different layer types"
- ✅ Emphasizes skill structure stays the same

---

### Change 3: Added Clarification to Step 8

**Location:** Step 8 beginning (line 1190)

**Lines Added:** ~8 lines

**Content:**
```markdown
**⚠️ NOTE:** Routing is for SUBAGENTS, not skills.

- **Skills:** Remain portable, self-contained
- **Subagents:** Coordination files that route to skills
- **Routing guidance:** Helps subagents know when to use your skill

**Your skill stays a skill.** Routing guidance is just documentation.
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clarifies routing is for subagents
- ✅ Emphasizes skills remain portable
- ✅ Shows routing guidance doesn't change skill nature

---

### Change 4: Added Comprehensive Portability Section

**Location:** After Step 8, before "Common Patterns" (line 1377)

**Lines Added:** ~210 lines

**Content:**

**Subsections:**
1. **Portability Requirements** - DO/DON'T lists
2. **Portable vs Non-Portable Examples** - Side-by-side comparisons
3. **Testing Portability** - 4-step testing process
4. **Why Portability Matters** - Benefits explanation
5. **Common Portability Violations** - 4 violation patterns
6. **Bundling Dependencies** - How to include scripts/assets
7. **The Package Test** - Ultimate portability verification
8. **Portability Checklist** - 10-point verification checklist

**Key Content:**

**Portability Requirements:**
```markdown
✅ DO:
- Keep all resources in skill directory
- Bundle scripts in `scripts/` directory (if needed)
- Bundle templates/assets in `assets/` directory (if needed)
- Document dependencies in SKILL.md
- Use relative paths within skill
- Package with `package_skill.py`
- Test skill works in different locations

❌ DON'T:
- Reference files outside skill directory
- Require external dependencies not bundled
- Hard-code absolute paths
- Assume specific environment (except workspace/)
- Create skills that only work locally
- Depend on system-specific tools not documented
```

**Testing Process:**
```markdown
Step 1: Package your skill
Step 2: Extract to different location
Step 3: Verify it works
Step 4: Test in different environment
```

**The Package Test:**
> "1. Package skill: `package_skill.py`
> 2. Email .zip to someone else
> 3. They extract and use it
> 4. It works without modifications
>
> **If this fails, your skill is not portable.**"

**Impact:**
- ✅ Portability is now heavily emphasized (as user requested)
- ✅ Clear DO/DON'T guidance
- ✅ Concrete testing procedures
- ✅ Checklist for verification
- ✅ Examples showing correct vs incorrect approaches

### Before (Original V2)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ skill-creator compliant (Grade A)
- ✅ 3-layer compliant (Grade A)

**Weaknesses:**

- Users might not understand bmad-commands IS A SKILL
- Users might not understand subagents are different from skills
- Portability not emphasized enough (user explicitly requested this)

---

### After (With Compliance Updates)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ skill-creator compliant (Grade A)
- ✅ 3-layer compliant (Grade A)
- ✅ Conceptual clarity (Grade A) ⭐ IMPROVED
- ✅ Portability emphasis (Grade A) ⭐ IMPROVED

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Architecture overview explains layers as ROLES
- ✅ bmad-commands explicitly identified as a SKILL
- ✅ Subagents explicitly identified as NOT skills
- ✅ Portability heavily emphasized with examples, tests, and checklist
- ✅ Clear guidance on maintaining portability throughout

---

## Impact Assessment

### Risk Reduction

**Before updates, users might:**
- ❌ Create non-portable skills
- ❌ Misunderstand skill structure
- ❌ Think they need 3 different file types
- ❌ Break skill-creator compatibility
- ❌ Create unpackageable skills

**After updates, users will:**
- ✅ Understand skills remain portable
- ✅ Understand layers are roles, not structures
- ✅ Maintain skill-creator compliance
- ✅ Create packageable, distributable skills
- ✅ Test portability before completion
