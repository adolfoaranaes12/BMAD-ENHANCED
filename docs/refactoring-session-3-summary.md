## Key Learnings from Session 3

### What Worked Well

1. **templates.md Pattern is Mature and Proven**
   - Now validated across 11 skills (100% success rate)
   - Predictable results: Create comprehensive templates.md → trim SKILL.md → validate
   - Skill-creator consistently accepts this pattern

2. **Batch Editing with Python for Large Files**
   - Used Python regex for aggressive trimming of trace-requirements
   - Saved ~240 lines in 3 batch operations
   - More efficient than individual Edit operations for large files

3. **Flexible Line Count Targets**
   - Skill-creator accepts wide range (222-529 lines)
   - Quality matters more than hitting exact line count
   - Complex skills (like trace-requirements) can be longer if well-structured

4. **Progressive Disclosure Works**
   - Moving ALL examples to templates.md keeps SKILL.md focused
   - "See: references/templates.md#section" pattern is clear and consistent
   - Users get complete information without SKILL.md bloat

### Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge 1: Very Large Initial File (trace-requirements 876 lines)**
- **Solution:** Used aggressive batch trimming with Python regex
- **Lesson:** For files >700 lines, batch operations are more efficient than individual edits

**Challenge 2: Balancing Completeness vs. Brevity**
- **Issue:** trace-requirements needed to remain comprehensive
- **Solution:** Accepted 529 lines (higher than target) but validated as Grade A
- **Lesson:** Skill-creator values structure and clarity over exact line count

**Challenge 3: Token Budget Management**
- **Issue:** Large file reads consumed tokens
- **Solution:** Used strategic reading (offset/limit) and batch operations
- **Lesson:** Plan token usage for large files, use batching when possible

**Challenge 4: Regex Group References**
- **Issue:** Complex regex with group references failed
- **Solution:** Simplified patterns, used multiple simpler Edit operations
- **Lesson:** Keep regex patterns simple for Edit operations

## Patterns and Best Practices Confirmed

### The Proven 7-Step Process (Refined)

1. **Step 0: Analyze Current State**
   - Read file (use offset/limit for large files)
   - Count lines
   - Check for existing reference files
   - Identify verbose sections

2. **Step 1: Create Directory Structure**
   - Usually already exists from partial refactoring
   - Verify references/ directory

3. **Step 2: Verify YAML Frontmatter**
   - Most skills already have frontmatter
   - Quick check, rarely needs changes

4. **Step 3: Create Comprehensive templates.md**
   - Target 700-1000 lines (be thorough!)
   - Include ALL output formats, examples, JSON structures
   - Include integration examples and workflows
   - This is the KEY to successful trimming

5. **Step 4: Systematically Trim SKILL.md**
   - Replace verbose step outputs with summaries + references
   - Condense verbose sections (integration, best practices)
   - Remove non-essential sections
   - For large files (>700 lines): Use Python batch operations

6. **Step 5: Validate with skill-creator**
   - Validate immediately after trimming
   - Don't batch multiple skills before validation
   - Trust Grade A validation (if it passes, it's good)

7. **Step 6: Check Line Count and Document**
   - Check final line count (accept 300-550 range)
   - Document results (original→final, reduction %, time)
   - Create .zip package (validation does this automatically)

### What to Include in templates.md

**Essential Sections:**
- ✅ Step-by-step output formats (ALL workflow steps)
- ✅ Complete example outputs with realistic data
- ✅ Error message templates
- ✅ Integration workflow examples
- ✅ JSON output format (complete structure)
- ✅ Configuration examples (complete YAML)
- ✅ Framework-specific examples (if applicable)

**Pro Tips:**
- Be comprehensive (700-1000 lines is fine!)
- Use realistic example data (not placeholders)
- Include complete structures (no "..." truncation)
- Format consistently (use markdown code blocks, tables)

## Recommendations for Session 4

### Target Skills (3 skills, ~61% → 78%)

**Suggested Next Batch:**
1. **execute-task** (development) - Complements implement-feature and run-tests
2. **refine-story** (planning) - Completes planning skills
3. **document-project** (brownfield) - Start brownfield category

**Rationale:**
- Complete development workflow (execute-task)
- Complete planning category (refine-story)
- Begin brownfield category (document-project)
- Balanced mix of categories

### Estimated Effort

**Time:** ~3-3.5 hours (similar to Session 3)
**Per-Skill:** ~60-70 minutes
**Token Budget:** ~120-130k of 200k

### Approach

1. **Use Proven 7-Step Process**
   - Create comprehensive templates.md first
   - Systematically trim SKILL.md
   - Validate immediately after each skill

2. **Efficiency Tips**
   - Check file sizes first (if >700 lines, plan batch operations)
   - Create templates.md with 700-1000 lines
   - Trust the process (100% success rate so far)
   - Accept line count range (300-550 is fine)

3. **Quality Checks**
   - Grade A validation required
   - 100% portable (no hardcoded paths)
   - Progressive disclosure via templates.md
   - Distributable .zip package
