# BMAD Enhanced: Complete AGILE Workflow Automation

**Vision:** Automate the entire AGILE development lifecycle from high-level architecture to production deployment using AI subagents.

**Date:** 2025-10-28

---

## Vision: AI-Powered AGILE Team

Transform this traditional AGILE team:

```
Traditional Team:
- Product Owner → Requirements, Prioritization
- Architect → System Design, Tech Decisions
- Scrum Master → Sprint Planning, Coordination
- Developers (3-5) → Implementation
- QA Engineers (2) → Testing, Quality
- DevOps → Deployment, Infrastructure
```

Into this AI-augmented team:

```
AI-Augmented Team:
- Human Product Owner → High-level vision, business goals
  ↓
- AI Subagents → Automated execution
  • Architect (System Design)
  • Planner (Sprint Planning, Story Breakdown)
  • Developer (Implementation)
  • QA (Testing, Quality Gates)
  • DevOps (Deployment)
  ↓
- Human Oversight → Review, Approve, Strategic Decisions
```

**Goal:** 10x productivity, maintain/improve quality, enable small teams to deliver like large teams.

---

## Complete AGILE Workflow

### Phase 1: Solution Architecture (Architect Subagent)

**Input:** High-level business requirements or strategic initiative

**Example:**
```
Business Requirement:
"We need to build a SaaS platform for team collaboration with
real-time messaging, file sharing, and video conferencing.
Target: 10,000 users, 99.9% uptime, GDPR compliant."
```

**Architect Subagent Commands:**

```bash
# Analyze requirements and propose architecture
@architect *analyze "SaaS collaboration platform requirements"

# Design system architecture
@architect *design-system "collaboration platform"

# Choose tech stack
@architect *tech-stack "real-time messaging, video conferencing"

# Create architectural decision records (ADRs)
@architect *adr "Why we chose WebRTC for video"

# Design data model
@architect *data-model "users, messages, files, calls"

# Design API contracts
@architect *api-design "REST vs GraphQL vs WebSockets"
```

**Architect Workflow:**

```
User: @architect *design-system "team collaboration platform with real-time features"

Architect: I'll design the system architecture for your collaboration platform.

[Step 1] Analyzing Requirements...
✓ Real-time messaging: WebSocket architecture required
✓ Video conferencing: WebRTC + media server needed
✓ File sharing: Object storage (S3) + CDN
✓ Scale: 10K users → Horizontal scaling strategy
✓ Compliance: GDPR → Data residency, encryption, audit logs

[Step 2] Proposing System Architecture...

└─────────┘         └───────────┘

[Step 3] Technology Stack Recommendations...

Frontend:
- Framework: React + TypeScript
- Real-time: Socket.io client
- Video: Simple-peer (WebRTC)
- State: Redux Toolkit
- UI: Tailwind CSS

Backend:
- Runtime: Node.js (Express)
- API: REST + WebSocket (Socket.io)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Cache: Redis
- Queue: RabbitMQ
- Media Server: Janus Gateway (WebRTC)

Infrastructure:
- Hosting: AWS (ECS + RDS + ElastiCache)
- Storage: S3 + CloudFront (CDN)
- Monitoring: Datadog
- Logging: CloudWatch

[Step 4] Creating Architectural Decision Records...
✓ ADR-001: Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for ACID compliance
✓ ADR-002: Chose WebSockets over HTTP polling for real-time
✓ ADR-003: Chose Janus over Mediasoup for WebRTC (better docs)
✓ ADR-004: Chose monorepo over separate repos (simpler deployment)

[Step 5] Defining Data Models...
✓ User (id, email, password, profile)
✓ Team (id, name, members)
✓ Channel (id, teamId, name, type: text/voice/video)
✓ Message (id, channelId, authorId, content, timestamp)
✓ File (id, name, url, uploaderId, size)
✓ Call (id, channelId, participants, startTime, endTime)

[Step 6] Designing API Contracts...
✓ REST API: /api/v1/users, /api/v1/teams, /api/v1/channels
✓ WebSocket: message.send, message.received, presence.update
✓ WebRTC Signaling: call.initiate, call.answer, call.ice-candidate

Architecture design complete!

- docs/architecture/system-design.md
- docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
- docs/architecture/data-model.md
- docs/architecture/api-design.md

### Phase 2: Sprint Planning (Planner Subagent)

**Input:** System architecture + Epics/Features

**Example:**
```
Epic: User Authentication & Authorization
Features:
- Email/password signup
- OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management
- Password reset
```

**Planner Subagent Commands:**

```bash
# Break epic into user stories
@planner *breakdown-epic "User Authentication & Authorization"

# Estimate stories (story points)
@planner *estimate-stories epic-auth

# Prioritize backlog
@planner *prioritize "by business value and dependencies"

# Plan sprint
@planner *plan-sprint "Sprint 15" --velocity 40

# Refine story
@planner *refine-story "As a user, I want to sign up with email"
```

**Planner Workflow:**

```
User: @planner *breakdown-epic "User Authentication & Authorization"

Planner: I'll break down the authentication epic into implementable user stories.

[Step 1] Analyzing Epic Scope...
✓ Authentication: Signup, Login, Logout
✓ Authorization: Roles, Permissions, Access Control
✓ Security: Password hashing, Token management, Rate limiting
✓ User Management: Profile, Password reset, Email verification

[Step 2] Creating User Stories with Acceptance Criteria...

Story 1: User Signup with Email/Password
Priority: P0 (Must Have)
Story Points: 5

As a user,
I want to sign up with email and password
So that I can create an account and access the platform.

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can enter email and password on signup form
- Password must be at least 8 characters with mixed case and numbers
- Email must be unique (duplicate check)
- Password is hashed with bcrypt before storage
- Confirmation email sent with verification link
- User cannot login until email verified

Dependencies: None
Technical Notes: Use Zod for validation, Prisma for database, Nodemailer for email

---

Story 2: User Login with Email/Password
Priority: P0 (Must Have)
Story Points: 3

As a user,
I want to login with my email and password
So that I can access my account.

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can enter email and password on login form
- Credentials validated against database
- JWT token generated on successful login (expires in 24h)
- User redirected to dashboard
- Failed login returns appropriate error
- Rate limiting: Max 5 attempts per minute per IP

Dependencies: Story 1 (Signup)
Technical Notes: JWT with 24h expiry, Redis for rate limiting

---

Story 3: OAuth Integration (Google)
Priority: P1 (Should Have)
Story Points: 8

As a user,
I want to sign in with my Google account
So that I don't need to create a separate password.

Acceptance Criteria:
- "Sign in with Google" button on login/signup pages
- OAuth flow redirects to Google for authentication
- User profile created/updated with Google data (name, email, avatar)
- Existing users can link Google account to their profile
- JWT token generated on successful OAuth login
- Security: Validate OAuth state parameter to prevent CSRF

Dependencies: Story 1 (Signup), Story 2 (Login)
Technical Notes: Use Passport.js + passport-google-oauth20

---

[Continues for all stories in epic...]

[Step 3] Estimating Story Points...

Story Points Distribution:
- Story 1 (Signup): 5 points
- Story 2 (Login): 3 points
- Story 3 (OAuth Google): 8 points
- Story 4 (OAuth GitHub): 5 points (similar to Google)
- Story 5 (RBAC): 13 points (complex)
- Story 6 (Password Reset): 5 points
- Story 7 (Session Management): 8 points
- Story 8 (Rate Limiting): 3 points

Total: 50 story points

[Step 4] Identifying Dependencies...

Dependency Graph:
Story 1 (Signup) → Story 2 (Login) → Story 3 (OAuth)
Story 1 (Signup) → Story 5 (RBAC)
Story 2 (Login) → Story 7 (Session Mgmt)
Story 2 (Login) → Story 8 (Rate Limiting)
Story 1 (Signup) → Story 6 (Password Reset)

Recommended Sprint Breakdown (assuming 40 point velocity):

Sprint 1:
- Story 1: Signup (5 pts)
- Story 2: Login (3 pts)
- Story 6: Password Reset (5 pts)
- Story 8: Rate Limiting (3 pts)
Total: 16 points

Sprint 2:
- Story 3: OAuth Google (8 pts)
- Story 4: OAuth GitHub (5 pts)
- Story 7: Session Management (8 pts)
Total: 21 points

Sprint 3:
- Story 5: RBAC (13 pts)
Total: 13 points

[Step 5] Creating Task Specifications...
✓ Created: .claude/tasks/task-001-user-signup.md
✓ Created: .claude/tasks/task-002-user-login.md
✓ Created: .claude/tasks/task-003-oauth-google.md
