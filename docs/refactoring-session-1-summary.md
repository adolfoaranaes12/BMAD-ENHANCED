## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **templates.md pattern highly effective**
   - Consolidates all output formats, examples, templates
   - Average 550-580 lines per templates.md file
   - Saves 60-100 lines from SKILL.md

2. **Systematic trimming approach**
   - Remove Philosophy sections entirely (not essential)
   - Trim verbose output examples ‚Üí reference templates.md
   - Condense step outputs to 1-2 lines + reference
   - Trim "Using This Skill" to 1-2 lines

3. **Progressive disclosure works**
   - SKILL.md stays lean (300-400 lines)
   - Reference files contain full details (400-600 lines each)
   - Total content actually INCREASED (more comprehensive)
   - But context window usage DECREASED dramatically

4. **V2 Architecture compliance**
   - YAML frontmatter with full contracts valuable
   - Telemetry tracking enables observability
   - bmad-commands integration documented clearly
   - Routing guidance helps subagent coordination

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Initial files already partially refactored**
   - implement-feature: 95% done (472 lines, needed <400)
   - review-task: 70% done (580 lines, needed <400)
   - create-task-spec: 85% done (515 lines, needed <400)
   - All had reference files but needed final polish

2. **Balancing comprehensiveness vs brevity**
   - Hard to know what to keep in SKILL.md vs move to references
   - Solution: Keep workflow, move examples/formats to references

3. **Source references missing in some skills**
   - Some technical details lacked [Source: filename#section] citations
   - Fixed during refactoring

### Time Per Skill

- **Skill 1 (implement-feature):** ~60 minutes
  - 15 min: Create templates.md (575 lines)
  - 35 min: Trim SKILL.md (10 edits)
  - 10 min: Validate with skill-creator

- **Skill 2 (review-task):** ~45 minutes
  - 15 min: Create templates.md (594 lines)
  - 20 min: Trim SKILL.md (11 edits)
  - 10 min: Validate with skill-creator

- **Skill 3 (create-task-spec):** ~60 minutes
  - 15 min: Create templates.md (554 lines)
  - 35 min: Trim SKILL.md (10 edits)
  - 10 min: Validate with skill-creator

**Total:** ~165 minutes (~2.75 hours actual work)

1. refactor-code (development)
2. breakdown-epic (planning)
3. quality-gate (quality)

**Estimated time:** 3-4 hours (learning curve flattening)

### Medium-term (Weeks 3-4)

**Refactor remaining 10 skills (44% ‚Üí 100% complete):**
- Development: run-tests
- Planning: refine-story
- Quality: nfr-assess, trace-requirements, risk-profile, test-design
- Implementation: execute-task, index-docs
- Brownfield: 2 skills

**Estimated time:** 10-12 hours

### Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Update `docs/REFACTORING-COMPLETE.md` with session 1 results
- [ ] Document templates.md pattern in refactoring guide
- [ ] Update skill-creator validation checklist
- [ ] Add "lessons learned" to refactoring template
