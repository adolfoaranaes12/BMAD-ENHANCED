# Skills Compliance Analysis - BMAD Enhanced

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-28
**Total Skills Analyzed:** 18
**Overall Compliance Grade:** **D+ / Failing**

---

## Executive Summary

### Critical Findings

🔴 **18/18 skills (100%) lack proper YAML frontmatter** - This is a blocking issue that would prevent skill packaging.

🔴 **17/18 skills (94%) exceed the 500-line limit** - Average length is 1,015 lines (2x the recommended maximum).

🟡 **Most skills include extraneous documentation** - "Invocation" sections, "Metadata" sections, and verbose explanations that should be removed or moved to reference files.

### What Works Well

✅ **Comprehensive content** - Skills demonstrate deep technical understanding
✅ **Clear workflows** - Sequential steps and logical progression
✅ **Good examples** - Realistic scenarios and code samples
✅ **Thoughtful design** - BMAD patterns are well-conceived

### What Must Change

1. **Add YAML frontmatter to ALL skills**
2. **Reduce length to under 500 lines** (split into references/)
3. **Remove user-facing documentation**
4. **Trust Claude's existing knowledge more**
5. **Create bundled resources** (references, scripts, assets)

- ❌ All have "## When to Use This Skill" (should be brief)
- ❌ Verbose explanations of concepts Claude already knows
- ❌ No references/ directories for split content
- ❌ Extremely prescriptive workflows (low freedom)

**Example Violation - estimate-stories.md:**
```markdown
❌ Lines 1,477 total (3x over limit)
❌ No YAML frontmatter
❌ Has "## Invocation" section (lines 16-34)
❌ Has "## When to Use This Skill" (lines 8-14)
❌ Detailed formula explanations Claude already knows
```

### Development Skills (3 skills)

| Skill | Lines | Frontmatter | Grade | Critical Issues |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| implement-feature.md | 1,573 | ❌ Missing | F | 3x over limit, no frontmatter |
| fix-issue.md | 949 | ❌ Missing | D | 1.9x over limit, no frontmatter |
| run-tests.md | 991 | ❌ Missing | D | 2x over limit, no frontmatter |

**Category Average:** 1,171 lines (2.3x over limit)

**Common Issues:**

- ❌ Extensive TDD explanations (Claude knows TDD)
- ❌ Common patterns should be in references/common-patterns.md
- ❌ Test examples should be in references/test-examples.md

**Example Violation - implement-feature.md:**
```markdown
❌ Lines 1,573 total (3x over limit!)
❌ No YAML frontmatter
❌ Lines 1444-1454: Explaining TDD Red-Green-Refactor (Claude knows this)
❌ Lines 287-383: Verbose test scaffolding examples
❌ Should split into:
   - SKILL.md (< 500 lines)
   - references/tdd-examples.md
   - references/test-patterns.md
   - assets/test-templates/
```

### Implementation Skills (1 skill)

| Skill | Lines | Frontmatter | Grade | Critical Issues |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| execute-task.md | 705 | ❌ Missing | D | 1.4x over limit, no frontmatter |

**Common Issues:**
- ❌ No YAML frontmatter
- ❌ Over length limit
- ❌ Overlaps significantly with implement-feature.md

### Brownfield Skills (1 skill)

| Skill | Lines | Frontmatter | Grade | Critical Issues |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| index-docs.md | 209 | ❌ Missing | C | **Only skill under 500 lines!** But still missing frontmatter |

**Notes:**
- ✅ **This is the ONLY skill under 500 lines!**
- ❌ Still missing YAML frontmatter
- ⚠️ Appears to be incomplete (only 209 lines suggests it's a stub)

### Quality Skills (7 skills)

| Skill | Lines | Frontmatter | Grade | Critical Issues |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| risk-profile.md | 987 | ❌ Missing | D | 2x over limit, no frontmatter |
| review-task.md | 778 | ❌ Missing | D | 1.5x over limit, orchestrator pattern |

| nfr-assess.md | 1,205 | ❌ Has "## Metadata" | F | 2.4x over limit, wrong frontmatter format |

**Category Average:** 987 lines (2x over limit)

**Common Issues:**
- ❌ 4/7 have "## Metadata" sections (should be YAML frontmatter)
- ❌ All significantly over length limit
- ❌ Extensive assessment frameworks could be in references/
- ❌ Scoring matrices should be in references/scoring-criteria.md

**Example Violation - quality-gate.md:**
```markdown
❌ Lines 1,057 total (2x over limit)
❌ Has "## Metadata" section (lines 3-9) - should be YAML frontmatter
❌ Extensive scoring matrices (should be references/scoring-criteria.md)
❌ Decision trees (should be references/decision-trees.md)
```

---

## Critical Issues by Type

### 1. Missing YAML Frontmatter (CRITICAL - Blocks Packaging)

**Affected:** 18/18 skills (100%)

**What's Required:**
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief one-line description of what the skill does (max 200 chars)
---
```

**Current State:**
- ❌ 14 skills: No frontmatter at all
- ❌ 4 skills: Have "## Metadata" markdown sections instead (wrong format)

**Impact:** Skills cannot be packaged or distributed without proper frontmatter.

### 2. Excessive Length (CRITICAL - Violates Token Economy)

**Affected:** 17/18 skills (94%)

**Requirement:** Under 500 lines
**Current State:**
- Average length: 1,015 lines (2x over limit)
- Longest: estimate-stories.md (1,573 lines - 3x over!)
- Only compliant: index-docs.md (209 lines)

**Length Distribution:**
```
0-500 lines:    1 skill  (6%)   ✅
501-750 lines:  1 skill  (6%)   🟡
751-1000 lines: 7 skills (39%)  🔴
1001+ lines:    9 skills (50%)  🔴🔴
```

**Impact:** Wastes context tokens, reduces skill invocation efficiency.

### 3. Extraneous Documentation (Violates "No Auxiliary Context")

**Affected:** 16/18 skills (89%)

**Violations:**
- "## Invocation" sections in 14 skills
- "## When to Use This Skill" sections in 16 skills (should be brief)
- "## Skill Configuration" sections in 2 skills
- "## Skill Metadata" sections in 4 skills
- HTML version comments in 12 skills

**Example from sprint-plan.md:**
```markdown
❌ Lines 16-34: ## Invocation with 19 lines of bash examples
❌ Lines 8-14: ## When to Use This Skill with 7 scenarios
❌ Lines 3-5: HTML version comments

Should remove: ~50 lines of user-facing docs
```

### 4. Inefficient Context Usage (Violates "Claude is Smart")

**Affected:** 15/18 skills (83%)

**Examples of Unnecessary Verbosity:**

**implement-feature.md (lines 1444-1454):**
```markdown
❌ Explaining TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   Claude already knows this fundamental pattern
```

**fix-issue.md (lines 695-824):**
```markdown
❌ 130 lines explaining "Common Issue Patterns"
   (Validation too strict, Missing error handling, Race conditions, Memory leaks, Wrong assumptions)
   Claude already has this debugging knowledge
```

**estimate-stories.md (lines 45-120):**
```markdown
❌ 75 lines explaining story point concepts
   Claude already understands Agile estimation
```

**Impact:** Wastes tokens on information Claude already has, reduces space for project-specific context.

### 5. Missing Progressive Disclosure

**Affected:** 18/18 skills (100%)

**What's Missing:**
- No `references/` directories
- No split content (all content is inline)
- No scripts for repetitive tasks
- No asset templates

**What Should Exist:**

```
.claude/skills/development/implement-feature/
├── SKILL.md (< 500 lines) ✅
├── references/
│   ├── tdd-workflow.md
│   ├── test-patterns.md
│   ├── common-errors.md
│   └── validation-strategies.md
├── scripts/
│   ├── generate_test_scaffold.py
│   └── run_test_suite.sh
└── assets/
    └── test-templates/
        ├── unit-test-template.ts
        └── integration-test-template.ts

.claude/skills/quality/quality-gate/
├── SKILL.md (< 500 lines) ✅
├── references/
│   ├── scoring-criteria.md
│   ├── decision-matrices.md
│   └── risk-thresholds.md
└── assets/
    └── gate-report-template.yaml
```

**Impact:** All content is loaded every time, no way to reference detailed information when needed.

### 6. Wrong Degree of Freedom

**Affected:** 12/18 skills (67%)

**Issue:** Many skills are extremely prescriptive with rigid "STEP 0, STEP 1, STEP 2..." workflows.

**Examples:**
- implement-feature.md: 8 rigid steps
- fix-issue.md: 8 rigid steps
- estimate-stories.md: 7 rigid steps
- refine-story.md: 9 rigid steps

**Better Approach:**
```markdown
❌ CURRENT (Low Freedom):
## STEP 0: Load Context
## STEP 1: Analyze Requirements
## STEP 2: Set Up Tests
## STEP 3: Write Tests
## STEP 4: Implement Code
## STEP 5: Refactor
## STEP 6: Validate
## STEP 7: Update Task File
## STEP 8: Present Summary

✅ BETTER (Medium Freedom):
## Workflow

1. **Understand** - Load task spec, identify acceptance criteria
2. **Test-First** - Write failing tests for each AC
3. **Implement** - Make tests pass with minimal code
4. **Validate** - Run full suite, check coverage
5. **Document** - Update task file, present results

*Adapt the workflow based on project context and complexity.*
```

## Recommendations by Priority

### Priority 1: Blocking Issues (Must Fix Before Packaging)

#### 1.1 Add YAML Frontmatter to All Skills

**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Impact:** Critical - blocks packaging

**Action:**
```bash
# For each skill file:
# 1. Add frontmatter at the very top
# 2. Remove "## Metadata" sections if present
# 3. Remove HTML version comments
```

**Example - fix-issue.md:**
```yaml
---
name: fix-issue
description: Debug and fix bugs by reproducing issues, identifying root causes, implementing fixes, and validating without regressions
---

# Fix Issue Skill

## Purpose
[rest of content...]
```

#### 1.2 Reduce All Skills to Under 500 Lines

**Effort:** 8-12 hours
**Impact:** Critical - violates token economy

**Strategy:**
1. Create `references/` directory for each skill
2. Move detailed examples to reference files
3. Move common patterns to shared references
4. Remove verbose explanations of known concepts
5. Keep only essential workflow in SKILL.md

**Example - implement-feature.md refactoring:**
```
Before: 1,573 lines
After:
- SKILL.md: 450 lines (essential workflow)
- references/tdd-examples.md: 400 lines
- references/test-patterns.md: 350 lines
- references/validation-strategies.md: 200 lines
- assets/test-templates/: 173 lines
Total saved in main file: 1,123 lines ✅
```

### Priority 2: Quality Issues (Should Fix Soon)

#### 2.1 Remove Extraneous Documentation

**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** High - improves token efficiency

**Actions:**
- Remove all "## Invocation" sections
- Remove "## Skill Configuration" sections
- Remove "## Skill Metadata" sections (replace with YAML)
- Simplify "## When to Use This Skill" to 1-2 sentences
- Remove HTML version comments

#### 2.2 Create Progressive Disclosure Structure

**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Impact:** High - enables efficient context loading

**Actions:**
1. Create `references/` directory for each skill category
2. Move detailed content to reference files
3. Create shared references across skills (e.g., `.claude/skills/references/common/`)
4. Add scripts for repetitive tasks
5. Add asset templates

**Suggested Structure:**
```

**Script to automate:**
```bash
# For each skill, prepend YAML frontmatter
for skill in .claude/skills/*/*.md; do
  name=$(basename "$skill" .md)
  # Extract first line of "## Purpose" for description
  desc=$(sed -n '/^## Purpose/,/^##/p' "$skill" | sed '1d;$d' | head -1 | tr -d '\n')

  # Create temp file with frontmatter
  echo "---" > temp.md
  echo "name: $name" >> temp.md
  echo "description: $desc" >> temp.md
  echo "---" >> temp.md
  echo "" >> temp.md
  cat "$skill" >> temp.md

  # Replace original
  mv temp.md "$skill"
done
```
