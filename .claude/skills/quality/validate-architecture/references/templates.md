## Next Steps

### If Validation PASSED (Score ≥ 70):
1. Review and address medium/low priority recommendations
2. Proceed to implementation
3. Schedule architecture review checkpoint at 30% implementation

### If Validation FAILED (Score < 70):
1. **Must Fix:** Address all critical issues
2. **Should Fix:** Address high-priority recommendations
3. **Re-validate:** Run validation again after fixes
4. Do NOT proceed to implementation until validation passes
