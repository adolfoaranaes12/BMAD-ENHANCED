notes: |
  This architecture FAILS validation with a score of 38/100 due to 8 critical issues:

  1. Missing Security Architecture (no auth, encryption, compliance)
  2. Missing Deployment Architecture (no hosting, CI/CD)
  3. Insufficient ADRs (1 out of 5 required)
  4. No technology justifications (React, Node.js, Express)
  5. No architecture diagrams
  6. Vague NFRs with no measurable targets
  7. Incomplete technology stack (50% missing)
  8. Poor ADR quality (no alternatives, no consequences)

  This represents an inadequate architecture document that is not ready for implementation.
  Major rework is required across all dimensions. The architecture may function but has
  significant gaps in security, deployment, and scalability planning.

  Estimated rework: 2-3 days of focused architecture work to bring up to acceptable standard.

  DO NOT proceed to implementation until all critical issues are resolved and
  re-validation passes with score ≥70.
