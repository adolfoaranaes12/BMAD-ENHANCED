## Step 0: Story Quality Assessment Output

### Assessment Output Format

```
Story Assessment:
- Current Quality: 1.5/4 (Poor)
- Ready for Sprint: ❌ No
- Issues Identified: 6
  * Title too generic (missing "how")
  * Narrative incomplete (no "As a..." format)
  * AC vague and untestable (2 AC, both generic)
  * Missing technical notes
  * No edge cases identified
  * No test scenarios
- Estimated Refinement: 15 minutes
```

### Quality Score Calculation

```
Quality Score = Average of:
- Title quality (1-4)
- Narrative quality (1-4)
- AC quality (1-4)
- Technical notes quality (1-4)
- Edge cases coverage (1-4)
- Dependencies clarity (1-4)
```

### INVEST Criteria Assessment

```
Definition of Ready (INVEST):

✅ Independent: Can be worked on without other stories
✅ Negotiable: Flexible on implementation details
✅ Valuable: Delivers clear value to user/business
❌ Estimable: Team CANNOT estimate with confidence (missing details)
❌ Small: Does NOT fit in one sprint (estimated >13 points)

---

## Step 1: User Story Narrative Refinement

### Standard Format

```
As a [persona],
I want to [action],
So that [benefit/value].
```

### Before/After Example 1: Login Story

**Before:**
```
Users should be able to login.
```

**After:**
```
As a registered user,
I want to log in with my email and password
So that I can access my personalized account and data securely.
```

**Refinement Rationale:**
- Added persona: "registered user" (specific)
- Specified action: "log in with email and password" (concrete mechanism)
- Articulated value: "access personalized account and data securely" (clear benefit)

---

### Before/After Example 2: Profile Management

**Before:**
```
Update profile
```

**After:**
```
As a registered user,
I want to edit my profile information (name, email, avatar)
So that my account details stay current and I can personalize my experience.
```

**Refinement Rationale:**
- Added persona: "registered user"
- Specified action: "edit profile information" with specific fields
- Articulated value: "keep details current + personalize experience"

---

### Before/After Example 3: Admin Feature

**Before:**
```
Admins can manage users
```

**After:**
```
As a system administrator,
I want to view, edit, and deactivate user accounts
So that I can maintain user data integrity and enforce access policies.
```

**Refinement Rationale:**
- Added persona: "system administrator" (not just "admin")
- Specified action: "view, edit, deactivate" (specific verbs)
- Articulated value: "data integrity + access policies" (business value)

---

## Step 2: Acceptance Criteria Development

### AC Best Practices

**Checklist:**
- ✓ Specific: No ambiguity about what needs to be true
- ✓ Testable: Can verify with a test case
- ✓ Implementation-independent: What, not how
- ✓ User-focused: From user perspective when possible
- ✓ Numbered: For easy reference (AC-1, AC-2, etc.)

### AC Categories

1. **Happy Path** (2-3 AC): Core functionality working correctly
2. **Validation** (2-3 AC): Input validation and format checking
3. **Error Handling** (2-3 AC): Failure scenarios with clear error messages
4. **Security** (1-2 AC): Authentication, authorization, data protection
5. **Performance** (1 AC): Response time or throughput requirements

### Before/After Example: Login Story

**Before (Poor AC):**
```
- Login works
- Error handling
```

**After (Comprehensive AC):**
```
**Happy Path:**
- AC-1: User can enter email and password on login form
- AC-2: Valid credentials return 200 with JWT token
- AC-3: User redirected to dashboard after successful login

**Validation:**
- AC-4: Invalid email format returns 400 with "Invalid email format"
- AC-5: Empty password returns 400 with "Password is required"

**Error Handling:**
- AC-6: Wrong password returns 401 with "Invalid credentials"
- AC-7: Non-existent email returns 401 with "Invalid credentials" (no enumeration)

**Security:**
- AC-8: Password never exposed in logs or responses
- AC-9: Login attempts logged with timestamp, IP, outcome
- AC-10: Account locked for 15 min after 5 failed attempts

**Performance:**
- AC-11: Login response time < 500ms for 95% of requests
```

**Improvement:**
- From 2 vague AC → 11 specific, testable AC
- Organized by category for clarity
- Each AC is verifiable with a test
- Includes success, validation, errors, security, performance

---

### Before/After Example: Profile Edit Story

**Before (Poor AC):**
```
- Can update profile
- Validation works
```

**After (Comprehensive AC):**
```
**Happy Path:**
- AC-1: User can click "Edit Profile" to access edit form
- AC-2: User can update name, email, avatar fields
- AC-3: Clicking "Save" updates profile and shows "Profile updated successfully"

**Validation:**
- AC-4: Name must be 2-50 characters, returns error if invalid
- AC-5: Email must be valid format and unique, returns error if duplicate
- AC-6: Avatar must be JPEG/PNG < 5MB, returns error if invalid

**Error Handling:**
- AC-7: Network error shows "Could not save, please try again"
- AC-8: Server error (500) shows "Server error, please contact support"

**Security:**
- AC-9: Email change requires password confirmation
- AC-10: Only authenticated user can edit their own profile

**Performance:**
- AC-11: Profile save response < 1s for 95% of requests
```

---

## Step 3: Edge Cases Identification

### Edge Case Categories

1. **Boundary Conditions:** Min/max lengths, exactly at limit values
2. **Unusual Input:** Special characters, unicode, whitespace
3. **Timing & Concurrency:** Simultaneous requests, race conditions
4. **State Transitions:** User already logged in, account changes mid-operation
5. **External Dependencies:** Database down, Redis unavailable, network failures
6. **Security Scenarios:** Brute force, injection attempts, XSS

### Example: Login Story Edge Cases

```
1. Password exactly 12 characters (minimum length) - should work
2. Email with + symbol (user+tag@domain.com) - should work
3. Whitespace at start/end of inputs - should trim automatically
4. Same user logs in from 2 browsers simultaneously - both should succeed
5. User changes password while login attempt in-flight - may succeed or fail gracefully
6. Database connection lost mid-login - return 500, don't lock account
7. 1000 rapid login attempts - rate limit kicks in, IP blocked temporarily
8. Email with unicode characters (日本@example.com) - handle or reject gracefully
9. Browser back button after logout - redirect to login, don't show cached data
10. JWT expires mid-session - refresh token or require re-login
```

### Example: Profile Edit Edge Cases

```
1. Name exactly 50 characters (max length) - should work
2. Email changes to existing email - reject with "Email already in use"
3. Two tabs edit profile simultaneously - last write wins, or use optimistic locking
4. Upload 5.1 MB avatar (just over limit) - reject with clear error
5. Network disconnects during save - show offline indicator, queue retry
6. User edits while another admin is viewing - no conflict, admin sees old data
7. SQL injection in name field - sanitize, don't execute
8. XSS attempt in bio field - escape HTML, don't render script tags
9. Password confirmation fails 3 times - lock edit form, require re-authentication
10. Email verification pending when user tries to change email - queue change, verify new email first
```

## Step 4: Technical Guidance

### Technical Notes Structure

1. **Technology Stack:** Languages, frameworks, libraries to use
2. **Architecture Patterns:** Repository, service layer, middleware patterns
3. **Security Considerations:** Hashing algorithms, rate limiting, validation
4. **Data Models:** Database schemas, field types, relationships
5. **API Contracts:** Request/response formats, status codes
6. **Performance Requirements:** Response times, throughput, indexes

### Example: Login Story Technical Notes

```markdown
## Technical Notes

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js 20.x with TypeScript
- Express.js for routing
- PostgreSQL 16 for user storage
- Redis 7 for rate limiting and session management
- bcrypt (cost 12) for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken for JWT generation
- Zod for input validation

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Controller Layer: HTTP request/response handling, input validation with Zod
2. Service Layer: Business logic, rate limiting, login attempt logging
3. Repository Layer: Database queries with parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)

**Security Considerations:**
- Password never leaves database unhashed
- JWT secret stored in environment variable (not committed to git)
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts / 10 min / IP address
- Error messages avoid email enumeration (same error for wrong email or password)
- HTTPS only for login endpoint
- JWT includes user ID and expiration, signed with HS256

**Data Models:**
users table:
  - id: UUID (primary key)
  - email: VARCHAR(254) UNIQUE NOT NULL
  - password_hash: VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL (bcrypt hash)
  - is_locked: BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
  - locked_until: TIMESTAMP NULL
  - created_at: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
  - updated_at: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

login_attempts table:
  - id: UUID (primary key)
  - user_id: UUID (foreign key to users.id, NULL if user not found)
  - ip_address: VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL
  - success: BOOLEAN NOT NULL
  - timestamp: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

**API Contract:**
POST /api/auth/login
Request:
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!"
  }
Success (200):
  {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "expiresIn": 3600,
    "user": {
      "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
      "email": "user@example.com"
    }
  }
Error (401):
  {
    "error": "Invalid credentials",
    "code": "AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS"
  }
Error (429):
  {
    "error": "Too many login attempts, try again in 10 minutes",
    "code": "AUTH_RATE_LIMITED",
    "retryAfter": 600
  }

**Performance:**
- Database query (email lookup): < 50ms (indexed on email column)
- Bcrypt password comparison: ~200ms (cost 12 is intentionally slow)
- JWT generation: < 10ms
- Total response time: < 500ms (p95)
- Concurrent users supported: 1000+ (horizontal scaling with Redis session store)

**Indexes:**
- users.email (unique index) - fast email lookup
- login_attempts.ip_address - fast rate limit checks
- login_attempts.timestamp - efficient cleanup of old records
```

### Example: Profile Edit Technical Notes

```markdown
## Technical Notes

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript (frontend)
- Node.js 20.x with Express (backend)
- PostgreSQL 16 for user storage
- AWS S3 for avatar storage
- sharp for image processing
- multer for file uploads

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Frontend: React form with react-hook-form + zod validation
2. Backend Controller: File upload handling, validation, S3 upload
3. Backend Service: Profile update logic, email change verification
4. Repository: Database update with optimistic locking

**Security Considerations:**
- Email change requires password confirmation
- Avatar upload restricted to JPEG/PNG, max 5MB
- Image files scanned for malware before upload to S3
- S3 objects private, served through signed URLs
- CSRF token required for profile updates

**Data Models:**
users table (updates):
  - name: VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
  - email: VARCHAR(254) UNIQUE NOT NULL
  - avatar_url: TEXT NULL (S3 URL)
  - email_verified: BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
  - version: INTEGER DEFAULT 1 (for optimistic locking)

**API Contract:**
PUT /api/users/:userId/profile
Request (multipart/form-data):
  - name: "John Doe"
  - email: "john.doe@example.com"
  - password_confirmation: "SecurePassword123!"
  - avatar: File (optional)
Success (200):
  {
    "user": {
      "id": "...",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "avatar_url": "https://s3.../avatar.jpg",
      "email_verified": false
    }
  }
Error (400):
  {
    "error": "Invalid email format",
    "code": "VALIDATION_EMAIL_INVALID"
  }

**Performance:**
- Avatar upload + resize: < 3s
- Profile update (no avatar): < 500ms
- S3 signed URL generation: < 100ms
```

## Step 5: Test Scenarios

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests** (Fast, Isolated): Test individual functions
2. **Integration Tests** (Medium, With Dependencies): Test multiple components
3. **E2E Tests** (Slow, Full System): Test complete workflows
4. **Performance Tests** (Optional): Test under load

### Example: Login Story Test Scenarios

```markdown
## Test Scenarios

### Unit Tests
- U-1: Validate email format (valid: "user@example.com", invalid: "invalid", invalid: "@example.com")
- U-2: Hash password with bcrypt (returns hash starting with "$2b$12$", different hash each time)
- U-3: Verify password against hash (returns true for correct password, false for incorrect)
- U-4: Check rate limit (returns true if under limit, false if over limit)
- U-5: Generate JWT token (token contains user ID, expires in 1 hour, verifiable with secret)

### Integration Tests
- I-1: Successful login with valid credentials (returns 200 with JWT token, logs attempt)
- I-2: Failed login with wrong password (returns 401, logs failure, increments attempt count)
- I-3: Failed login with non-existent email (returns 401, same error as wrong password)
- I-4: Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (returns 429 on 6th attempt, locked_until set)
- I-5: Successful login after lockout expires (returns 200, resets attempt count)
- I-6: Login with whitespace in email (trims whitespace, succeeds if valid)

### E2E Tests
- E-1: Complete signup and login flow (signup → verify email → login → access protected route → logout)
- E-2: Login failure flow (attempt login with wrong password → see error → retry with correct → success)
- E-3: Account lockout and recovery (5 failed attempts → locked → wait 15 min → retry → success)
- E-4: Session persistence (login → close browser → reopen → still logged in via JWT)
- E-5: Token expiration (login → wait 1 hour → token expires → redirect to login)

### Performance Tests
- P-1: 100 concurrent logins (all succeed, avg response < 500ms, no errors)
- P-2: 1000 rapid login attempts (rate limiting works, no database overload)
```

### Example: Profile Edit Test Scenarios

```markdown
## Test Scenarios

### Unit Tests
- U-1: Validate name length (valid: 2-50 chars, invalid: 1 char, invalid: 51 chars)
- U-2: Validate email format (valid formats, invalid formats)
- U-3: Validate avatar file type (accept JPEG/PNG, reject PDF/EXE)
- U-4: Validate avatar file size (accept < 5MB, reject >= 5MB)
- U-5: Resize avatar image (input 4000x3000 → output 400x400, maintains aspect ratio)

### Integration Tests
- I-1: Update name and email (returns 200, user record updated, email verification sent)
- I-2: Update with duplicate email (returns 400, no update, error message shown)
- I-3: Upload valid avatar (returns 200, image uploaded to S3, avatar_url updated)
- I-4: Upload oversized avatar (returns 400, no upload, clear error message)
- I-5: Update without password confirmation (returns 403, no update)
- I-6: Concurrent updates (optimistic locking detects conflict, second update fails with 409)

### E2E Tests
- E-1: Complete profile edit flow (login → navigate to profile → edit fields → save → see success → verify changes)
- E-2: Avatar upload flow (click "Change Avatar" → select file → preview → save → see new avatar)
- E-3: Email change verification (change email → receive verification email → click link → email confirmed)
- E-4: Validation error recovery (submit invalid email → see error → fix → retry → success)

### Performance Tests
- P-1: 50 concurrent profile updates (all succeed, avg response < 1s)
- P-2: Avatar upload with 4.9 MB file (completes < 3s, resized correctly)
```

2. Special characters in email (unusual input)
3. Whitespace trimming (data quality)
4. Concurrent logins (concurrency)
5. Password change during login (state transition)
6. Database failure (external dependency)
7. Brute force attempts (security)

**Value:** Reduces production bugs, improves robustness

### Created Test Scenarios

**Added test coverage:**
- Unit tests (3 scenarios): Email validation, password hashing, verification
- Integration tests (3 scenarios): Success, failure, rate limiting
- E2E tests (1 scenario): Full signup → login → protected access flow

**Value:** Clear QA guidance, testable acceptance criteria

## Next Steps

1. **Estimate Story Points**
   - Recommended: 5 points (medium complexity, clear requirements)
   - Confidence: 90% (all details defined)

2. **Add to Sprint Backlog**
   - Priority: P0 (critical auth functionality)
   - Sprint: Next available sprint
   - Dependencies: Requires story-auth-000 (registration) complete

3. **Assign to Developer**
   - Suggested: Developer with Node.js + security experience
   - Est. completion: 1 day (with tests and review)

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Use test scenarios for QA test plan
   - Security review required (auth-related)
   - Performance testing recommended (< 500ms target)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Original story lacked context:** No persona, vague action, missing value proposition
2. **AC were untestable:** "Login works" is not verifiable
3. **Missing security considerations:** Rate limiting, account lockout not considered
4. **No performance requirements:** Could lead to slow implementation
5. **Edge cases discovered during refinement:** Would have been production bugs

**Recommendation:** All authentication stories should include security AC and edge cases by default.
