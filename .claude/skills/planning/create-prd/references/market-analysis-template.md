# Market Analysis Template

## Overview

Market analysis evaluates competitive landscape, market positioning, and go-to-market strategy. Use this template to systematically analyze the market opportunity and differentiation strategy.

## Section 1: Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

**Definition:** Products that solve the same problem for the same users in similar ways.

**Analysis Framework:**

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Market Share | Target Users |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| [Name] | [Key strengths] | [Key weaknesses] | [$ or tier] | [% or "Small/Med/Large"] | [Primary users] |

**Example:**
```
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Market Share | Target Users |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Asana | Strong integrations, enterprise features | Complex UI, slow mobile app | $10.99/user/mo | 25% (large) | Enterprise teams |
| Trello | Simple UI, visual boards | Limited advanced features | $5/user/mo | 30% (large) | Small teams, individuals |
| Monday.com | Customizable, automation | Expensive, learning curve | $8-16/user/mo | 20% (medium) | Mid-size teams |
```

### Indirect Competitors & Alternatives

**Definition:** Different solutions users employ to solve the same problem.

**Examples:**
- Spreadsheets (Excel/Google Sheets)
- Email/Calendar combo
- Pen and paper/whiteboards
- Generic tools (Notion, Airtable)
- DIY/in-house solutions

**Why This Matters:**
Understanding what users currently use reveals:
- Minimum viable functionality (what spreadsheets can't do well)
- User habits and workflows
- Switching costs and barriers
- Price sensitivity

**Example:**
```
Current Alternative: Excel Spreadsheets
- Pros: Familiar, flexible, no cost
- Cons: No collaboration, version control issues, manual updates
- Switching Barrier: Medium (data migration, training)
- Our Advantage: Real-time collaboration, automated updates, mobile access
```

### Competitive Positioning Matrix

**Visual Framework:**

```
High Price
    │
    │  [Premium]        [Overpriced]
    │  - Competitor A    - Competitor C
    │
────┼─────────────────────────────────
    │
    │  [Value]          [Budget]
    │  - Our Product    - Competitor B
    │
Low Price
    │
Simple ────────────────────────── Advanced
        Feature Richness
```

**How to Use:**
1. Plot competitors on 2D matrix (Price vs Features)
2. Identify positioning opportunities
3. Choose strategic position based on target market

## Section 2: Market Segmentation

### Target Market Definition

**Framework:**

**Primary Market (Who We're Building For):**
- **Size:** [TAM, SAM, SOM estimates]
- **Characteristics:** [Demographics, firmographics, behaviors]
- **Pain Points:** [Top 3-5 problems we solve]
- **Willingness to Pay:** [Price sensitivity analysis]
- **Accessibility:** [How easy to reach this market]

**Secondary Markets:**
- [Other segments that could benefit]
- [Why not primary focus]

**Non-Target Markets:**
- [Segments we explicitly don't serve]
- [Why we're excluding them]

**Example:**
```
PRIMARY MARKET: Small Marketing Agencies (2-20 employees)
- Size: 50,000 agencies in US (SAM: $500M)
- Pain Points: Client management chaos, manual reporting, scattered tools
- Willingness to Pay: $20-50/user/month (budgets tight but pain high)
- Accessibility: Active on social media, attend MarketingProfs events

SECONDARY MARKETS: Freelance marketers, in-house teams
- Could benefit but have different needs
- Focus after PMF with primary market

NON-TARGET: Enterprise (500+ employees)
- Different needs (compliance, integrations, enterprise sales cycle)
- Better served by competitors with enterprise focus
```

## Section 3: Differentiation Strategy

### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

**Template:**
```
For [target market]
Who [statement of need or opportunity],
[Product name] is a [product category]
That [key benefit, reason to buy].
Unlike [primary competitive alternative],
Our product [statement of primary differentiation].
```

**Example:**
```
For small marketing agencies
Who struggle with scattered tools and manual client reporting,
AgencyOS is an all-in-one client management platform
That centralizes projects, time tracking, and automated reporting.
Unlike general project tools like Asana,
Our product is purpose-built for agency workflows with white-label client portals.
```

### Differentiation Pillars

**Framework:** Identify 2-3 core differentiators

**Types of Differentiation:**
1. **Feature Differentiation** - Unique capabilities

## Section 5: Go-to-Market Strategy

### Distribution Channels

**Framework:**

**Primary Channel:**
- [How users will discover and acquire product]
- [Why this channel for target market]
- [Cost and timeline to establish]

**Secondary Channels:**
- [Additional channels]

**Anti-Channels:**
- [Channels we explicitly avoid]

- Free tier with self-serve upgrade
- Viral loops (invite team members, share client portals)
- Why: Marketing agencies are DIY, prefer try-before-buy
- Cost: Low CAC, scales well

SECONDARY: Content Marketing + SEO
- Target keywords like "agency project management"
- Educational content for agency owners
- Why: Agencies search for solutions, high intent
- Timeline: 6-12 months to gain traction

ANTI-CHANNELS:
- Enterprise sales (high CAC, long cycles, doesn't fit small agencies)
- Paid ads (agencies are skeptical, low conversion)
```

### Pricing Strategy

**Framework:**

**Pricing Model:**
- [ ] Per-user pricing
- [ ] Per-feature tier pricing
- [ ] Flat-rate pricing
- [ ] Usage-based pricing
- [ ] Freemium + paid tiers

**Pricing Rationale:**
- Market benchmarks (competitors)
- Value delivered (ROI calculation)
- Target customer willingness-to-pay
- Business model sustainability

**Example:**
```
PRICING MODEL: Freemium + Per-User Tiers

FREE TIER:
- 1 user, 3 clients, basic features
- Goal: Low-friction trial, viral growth (invite teammates)

STARTER ($15/user/month):
- Unlimited clients, core features
- Target: Solo freelancers and small agencies (2-5 people)

PROFESSIONAL ($30/user/month):
- Advanced features (automations, white-label, integrations)
- Target: Growing agencies (5-20 people)

RATIONALE:
- Competitor range: $5-50/user/month
- Value: Replaces $150-300/month in tools (Asana+Harvest+Google Workspace)
- ROI: Saves 5-10 hours/week per user = $500-1000/month value
- Willingness-to-pay validated: 68% of agencies pay $20-40/user for tools
```

## Section 6: Market Opportunity Sizing

### TAM, SAM, SOM Analysis

**Definitions:**
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** Total market demand if 100% market share
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** Portion of TAM we can realistically serve
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** Portion we can realistically capture in near term

**Calculation Methods:**

**Top-Down (Industry Reports):**
```
TAM: Global project management software market = $6B (2024)
SAM: Marketing agency segment = 8% of TAM = $480M
SOM: Realistic capture (1-2% of SAM in 3 years) = $5-10M
```

**Bottom-Up (Unit Economics):**
```
Target Market: 50,000 small marketing agencies in US
Pricing: $30/user/month average
Avg Agency Size: 8 users
Annual Revenue per Agency: $30 × 8 × 12 = $2,880

TAM: 50,000 agencies × $2,880 = $144M (US only)
SAM: 30% addressable (others use in-house or large competitors) = $43M
SOM: 5% capture in 3 years = $2.2M ARR
```

## Common Market Analysis Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Underestimating Indirect Competition

**Bad:** "We have no competitors; this is unique."
**Good:** "Users currently solve this with Excel. Our advantage is X, Y, Z."

**Why:** Every problem has a solution (even if it's "do nothing"). Understand the status quo.

---

### Mistake 2: Feature Parity as Strategy

**Bad:** "We'll have all the features Asana has, plus one more."
**Good:** "We focus on agency workflows; Asana focuses on general teams."

**Why:** Feature parity isn't differentiation. Focus on doing something significantly better for a specific audience.

---

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Switching Costs

**Bad:** "Our product is better, so users will switch."
**Good:** "Users have data in Asana + trained teams. We need migration tools + onboarding."

**Why:** Being "better" isn't enough. Switching must be 10x better to overcome inertia.

---

### Mistake 4: Optimistic Market Sizing

**Bad:** "$100B market, we'll capture 1% = $1B revenue!"
**Good:** "Realistic capture in 3 years with our resources: $5-10M ARR."

**Why:** TAM ≠ Opportunity. Be realistic about addressable and obtainable market.
