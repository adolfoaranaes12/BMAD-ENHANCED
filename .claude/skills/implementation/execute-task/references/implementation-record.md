# Implementation Record Guide

## Purpose

Template and format for maintaining comprehensive implementation documentation in task files.

---

## Implementation Record Structure

The Implementation Record section is the ONLY section of the task file that the execute-task skill is authorized to modify.

### Complete Template

```markdown

[Model identifier, e.g., claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929]

### Debug Log References

[Optional section for complex debugging notes]

### Completion Notes

[Detailed notes about implementation, decisions, learnings]

### Files Modified

**Created:**
- [List of new files]

**Modified:**
- [List of modified files]

### Testing Results

[Comprehensive test execution results]
```

---

## Section Details

### 1. Agent Model Used

**Purpose:** Track which AI model performed the implementation.

**Format:**
```markdown
### Agent Model Used

claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
```

**When to update:** At the start of Step 0 (configuration loading)

---

### 2. Debug Log References (Optional)

**Purpose:** Document complex issues and resolutions.

**When to use:**
- Encountered difficult bugs
- Spent significant time debugging
- Non-obvious solutions required
- Want to reference detailed debug logs

**Format:**
```markdown
### Debug Log References

**Issue 1: Unicode Email Validation Edge Case**
- Problem: Emails with unicode characters bypassing validation
- Investigation: Lines 234-289 of debug log
- Root cause: Missing punycode encoding check
- Resolution: Added punycode.toASCII() before validation
- Time spent: 15 minutes
- Reference: Debug log entry #12 (2025-10-29 11:45 AM)

**Issue 2: bcrypt Async Timeout in Tests**
- Problem: Tests timing out with default 5s limit
- Investigation: Lines 567-580 of debug log
- Root cause: bcrypt cost 12 takes ~200ms per hash
- Resolution: Increased test timeout to 10s
- Time spent: 5 minutes
- Reference: Debug log entry #18 (2025-10-29 1:20 PM)
```

**When to skip:** Most tasks won't need this section. Only add for complex debugging scenarios.

---

### 3. Completion Notes

**Purpose:** Document implementation details, decisions, learnings, and deviations.

**Format:**
```markdown
### Completion Notes

**[Task Name/Number]:**
- [What was implemented]
- [Key decisions made]
- [Patterns used/reused]
- [Edge cases discovered]
- [Performance notes]
- [Test results summary]
- [Learnings for future tasks]

[Repeat for each task]

**Key Learnings:**
- [Important patterns or insights]
- [Things to remember for future tasks]

**Deviations from Spec:**
- [Any changes from original task spec]
  Reason: [Why the deviation was necessary]
  Impact: [What changed and any implications]
```

**Detailed Example:**
```markdown
### Completion Notes

**Task 1: Create User Model**
- Implemented User interface with id, email, password, createdAt, updatedAt
- Created Zod schema with comprehensive validation:
  - Email: RFC 5322 compliant regex
  - Password: Min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char
- Database migration with UUID primary key, unique email constraint
- 12 unit tests written, all passing (94% coverage)
- **Edge case discovered:** Unicode emails (e.g., josé@example.com)
  - Added punycode encoding check to handle international characters
  - Validates both unicode and ASCII versions
  - Adds ~5ms to validation time (acceptable)

**Task 2: Implement Signup Service**
- Service class with createUser method
- bcrypt password hashing with cost 12 (~150ms per hash)
- Duplicate email check with database query before insert
- Transaction support ensures user + email record created atomically
- 8 unit tests written, all passing
- **Reused pattern:** Auth middleware structure from task-003
  - Same error handling approach
  - Consistent response format
  - Saved ~30 minutes of design time

**Task 3: Create API Endpoint**
- POST /api/auth/signup endpoint in src/routes/auth/signup.ts
- Request validation middleware applies Zod schema
- Error handling for all cases:
  - 400: Validation errors (invalid email/password)
  - 409: Duplicate email (user already exists)
  - 500: Internal errors (database/email service failures)
- 5 integration tests, all passing
- **Performance:** Average response time 145ms (within 200ms target)

**Task 4: Add Email Verification**
- Integrated email service from src/services/email
- Created confirmation email template with verification link
- Token generation using JWT (expires in 24 hours)
- 2 integration tests with mocked email service
- **Note:** Email service already configured in environment

**Task 5: Comprehensive Tests**
- 2 E2E tests for complete signup flow:
  1. Happy path: Valid signup → email sent → success response
  2. Error path: Duplicate email → 409 response
- Total tests: 27 (12 unit + 8 service + 5 integration + 2 E2E)
- All tests passing, execution time 4.2s
- Coverage: 94.2% statements, 89.1% branches, 100% functions

**Key Learnings:**
- bcrypt cost 12 performance impact is acceptable for auth endpoints
- Unicode email handling is more complex than expected, worth a helper function
- Email service mock pattern (jest.mock) works well, can reuse for notifications
- Transaction support is critical for multi-step operations (user + email)
- Zod schemas provide excellent TypeScript integration and error messages

**Deviations from Spec:**
- **Added:** Punycode encoding check for unicode emails
  Reason: Discovered edge case during testing where unicode emails could bypass validation
  Impact: +5ms validation time, no breaking changes, improved security
- **Added:** Transaction support for user creation
  Reason: Ensure atomicity (user + email record created together or not at all)
  Impact: Slight complexity increase, significant reliability improvement
```

**Best Practices:**
- Update after each task completion
- Be specific and detailed
- Document non-obvious decisions
- Note performance characteristics
- Record patterns that can be reused
- Highlight deviations and explain why

### 4. Files Modified

**Purpose:** Track all files created or modified during implementation.

**Format:**
```markdown
